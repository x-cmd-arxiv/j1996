The profile is singular,\napproaching the halo center with $\\rho\\propto r^{-1}$. It had been argued\npreviously that radially distorted, gravitationally lensed images of background\nsources in galaxy clusters, so-called radial arcs, required a flat core in the\ncluster density profile. Such radial arcs have so far been detected in two\ngalaxy clusters, in apparent contradiction with a singular density profile. I\nshow here that the profile suggested by Navarro et al. can produce radial arcs\ndespite its central singularity, and describe how the two parameters of the\nprofile can be determined in clusters where radial and tangential arcs are\nobserved. I then apply this analysis to the two clusters where radial arcs were\ndetected. In both cases, the redshifts of the radial arcs are yet unknown,\nhence definitive conclusions on the profile parameters cannot yet be drawn.\nNumerically determined values for the parameters of cluster-sized halos can,\nhowever, be used to predict the range of the unknown arc redshifts, thus\nproviding a direct observational test for the proposed density profile. A\npotential difficulty with the profile is that the radial magnification of\ntangential arcs is large, hence tangential arcs should be thick or their\nsources should be very thin in the radial direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 1996 06:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}
