Assuming that the\nperiod derivative $\\dot P$ of pulsars is a measure of their magnetic dipole\nmoment, the gravitational wave amplitude can be related to the observable\nparameters $P$ and $\\dot P$ and to a factor $\\beta$ which measures the\nefficiency of a given magnetic dipole moment in distorting the star. $\\beta$\ndepends on the nuclear matter equation of state and on the magnetic field\ndistribution.

In this paper, we consider the zeta function defined for\nthe space of pairs of binary Hermitian forms.

Our main result is Theorem (8.15). Our case resembles the space\nof pairs of binary quadratic forms which we discussed in Chapter 5 [5].\nHowever, the meaning of the problem, the pole structure of the adjusted zeta\nfunction, and the adjusting terms are different from those of the above case.\nThe zeta function of our case is a counting function of the class number times\nthe regulator of fields of the form k(sqrt(B_0),sqrt(B)) with B_0 fixed and B\nin k_, whereas the zeta function for the above case is essentially the same as\nthe space of binary quadratic forms.
