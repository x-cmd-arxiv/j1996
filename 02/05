Consider an associative algebra $A$ and two its\nsubalgebras $B$ and $N$ such that $A=B\\otimes N$ as a vector space. We prove\nthat the endomorphism algebra of the semiregular $A$-module appears naturally\nin semiinfinite cohomology theory as a ``two times Koszul dual'' to the algebra\n$A$. We compare semiinfinite cohomology of universal enveloping algebras with\nthe well-known Lie algebra semiinfinite cohomology. A new description of the\ncritical 2-cocycle is provided. As a consequence we obtain another proof of the\nfact that additive categories generated by Verma modules over affine Lie\nalgebras on dual levels are antiequivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Feb 1996 15:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
