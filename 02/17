The nonlinear gravitational interaction is treated as the sum of\nvarious individual spherical top-hat clustering. Because no collapsed halo of\nmass M can exist in initial regions (or top-hat spheres) of mass less than M,\nthe bias that massive halos have stronger correlation than the background mass\ncan be naturally introduced. We apply this method to derive constraints on\npopular dark-matter models from the spatial number density and the correlation\nfunction of C IV absorption systems in QSO spectra. Considering C IV systems\nshould behosted by collapsed halos, one can obtain an upper limit to the\nthreshold mass of the collapsed halos by requiring their number density to be\nlarger than that of observed C IV systems. On the other hand, in order to\nexplain the observed clustering of C IV systems, a lower limit to the threshold\nmass will be set for the hosting halos. The cold dark matter model, the Lamda\nCDM model and the cold-plus-hot dark matter model are tested using the C IV\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 1996 18:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Elaborating on the hierarchical\nclustering scheme of galaxy formation proposed by Cole et al., we assume that\ngalaxies form stars quiescently in a disk until they are disrupted into a\nspheroidal configuration by mergers. We calculate formation and merging\nhistories, and the evolution in colour, luminosity and morphology of the galaxy\npopulations in different environments. Roughly $ 50\\ %$ of ellipticals in our\nmodel have undergone a major merger since $z = 0.5$, yet in spite of this we\nfind that cluster ellipticals have colour-magnitude diagrams with remarkably\nsmall scatter. The morphological mix of galaxies that become rich cluster\nmembers at high redshift is dominated by spiral galaxies, due to the long\ntimescale for galaxy mergers compared with the timescale for cluster assembly\nat high redshift. The assembly of low redshift clusters is slower, allowing\nmore galaxy mergers to occur in the progenitor halos. As a result $z=0$ rich\nclusters become E/S0 dominated and we find a ``Butcher-Oemler'' effect that\nbecomes weaker for poorer groups at high redshift. The field luminosity\nfunction of red galaxies shows little evolution out to $z\\simeq 1$ and the\nreddest galaxies at these redshifts are as bright as their local counterparts.\nThe blue luminosity function, on the other hand, evolves rapidly with redshift,\nincreasing its characteristic luminosity and becoming steeper at the faint end.\nThese trends are similar to those recently observed in the Canada-France\nRedshift Survey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Feb 1996 12:46:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
