If G is a locally compact\n(second countable) groupoid, we show that B(G), the linear span of the Borel\npositive definite functions on G, is a Banach algebra when represented as an\nalgebra of completely bounded maps on a C^*-algebra associated with G. This\nnecessarily involves identifying equivalent elements of B(G). An example shows\nthat the linear span of the continuous positive definite functions need not be\ncomplete. For groups, B(G) is isometric to the Banach space dual of C^*(G). For\ngroupoids, the best analog of that fact is to be found in a representation of\nB(G) as a Banach space of completely bounded maps from a C^*-algebra associated\nwith G to a C^*-algebra associated with the equivalence relation induced by G.\nThis paper adds weight to the clues in the earlier study of Fourier-Stieltjes\nalgebras that there is a much more general kind of duality for Banach algebras\nwaiting to be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Feb 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
