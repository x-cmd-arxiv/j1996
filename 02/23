This empirical law assumes\nthat the surface brightness profile is a combination of two power laws with\ndifferent slopes gamma and beta for the inner and outer regions. Conventional\nstructural parameters such as core radius and central surface brightness are\nreplaced by break radius r_b, where the transition between power-law slopes\ntakes place, and surface brightness mu_b at that radius. An additional\nparameter alpha describes the sharpness of the break. The structural parameters\nare derived using a chi-squared minimization process applied to the mean\nsurface brightness profiles. The resulting model profiles generally give very\ngood agreement to the observed profiles out to the radius of 10 arcseconds\nimaged by the Planetary Camera. Exceptions include galaxies which depart from\npure power-laws at large radius, those with strong nuclear components, and\ngalaxies partly obscured by dust. The uncertainties in the derived parameters\nare estimated using Monte-Carlo simulations which test the stability of\nsolutions in the face of photon noise and the effects of the deconvolution\nprocess. The covariance of the structural parameters is examined by computing\ncontours of constant chi squared in multi-dimensional parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 1996 19:36:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

For a single screen time, there are an\ninfinite number of images of a black hole event horizon, almost all of which\nhave smaller area on the screen than the horizon area. This is consistent with\nthe focusing equation because of the existence of focal points. However, the\n{\\it boundary} of the past (or future) of the screen obeys the area theorem,\nand so always gives an expanding map to the screen, as required by the\nholographic hypothesis. These considerations are illustrated with several\naxisymmetric static black hole spacetimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Feb 1996 17:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-12-30"}

They agree only\nwhen the photon is massless. For a massive fermion and massless photon, we show\nthat there is no consistent solution at all, the infrared divergences\nintroduced by the approximation forbidding even the trivial solution. When both\nfermion and photon are massive, we find a non-perturbative (extra) fermion mass\ngeneration (which survives in the limit when the bare mass of the fermion tends\nto zero). We argue that, in this case, the ladder approximation will provide\nreliable results if the bare masses of the fields are large compared with the\n(dimensionful) coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 1996 02:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2017-12-21"}
