We\nalso examine other observationally and physically motivated mass models,\nspecifically those obtained from X-ray observations and N-body simulations. The\naim of this analysis is to understand qualitatively the structure of the core\nand test some of the key assumptions of the standard picture of cluster\nformation regarding relaxation, virialization and equilibrium. This technique\nis applied to the cluster Abell 2218, where we find evidence for an anisotropic\ncore, which we interpret to indicate the existence of a dynamically disturbed\ncentral region.

Two of the triad vectors are null, and in\nmany respects they play the role similar to the principal null directions in\nthe algebraically special 4-D spacetimes.

A reformulation of SUSYQM\nin the full line $\\left( -\\infty, \\infty \\right)$ is subsequently developed. It\nis found that the second formulation makes a connection between states having\nthe same quantum number $L$ but different values of $\\eta \\sigma^{2}$ and\nquantum number $N$. This is in contrast to the first formulation, which relates\nstates with identical values of the quantum number $N$ and $\\eta \\sigma^{2}$\nbut different values of the quantum number $L$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Feb 1996 14:51:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2013-12-19"}
