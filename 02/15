They can be significant in two ways: Individual modes may dominate\nthe time evolution of some perturbation, and a whole set of them could be used\nto completely describe this time evolution. It is known that quasinormal modes\nof black holes have the first property, but not the second. It has recently\nbeen suggested that a discontinuity in the underlying system would make the\ncorresponding set of quasinormal modes complete. We therefore turn the\nRegge-Wheeler potential, which describes perturbations of Schwarzschild black\nholes, into a series of step potentials, hoping to obtain a set of quasinormal\nmodes which shows both of the above properties. This hope proves to be futile,\nthough: The resulting set of modes appears to be complete, but it does not\ncontain any individual mode any more which is directly obvious in the time\nevolution of initial data. Even worse: The quasinormal frequencies obtained in\nthis way seem to be extremely sensitive to very small changes in the underlying\npotential. The question arises whether - and how - it is possible to make any\ndefinite statements about the significance of quasinormal modes of black holes\nat all, and whether it could be possible to obtain a set of quasinormal modes\nwith the desired properties in another way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Feb 1996 18:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The refinement takes into\naccount the gauge-fixing ambiguities coming from gauge transformations which\nleave the critical point unchanged, resulting in the absence of infrared\ndivergences when the critical point is isolated modulo gauge transformations.\nThe procedure can be carried out using only the subgroup of gauge\ntransformations which are topologically trivial, possibly avoiding the usual\nproblems which arise due to gauge-fixing ambiguities.
