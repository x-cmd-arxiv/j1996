NGC~2915 has the HI properties of a late\ntype spiral galaxy (Sd - Sm), including a double horn global profile, and HI\nspiral arms. The HI extends out to over five times the Holmberg radius. The\noptical counterpart corresponds to a central HI bar. The rotation curve is\nderived and fitted with a mass model consisting of a stellar disk, a neutral\ngas disk, and a dark matter (DM) halo. The DM halo dominates at nearly all\nradii. The total mass to blue light ratio is 76 within the last measured point,\nmaking NGC~2915 one of the darkest disk galaxies known. The core of the DM halo\nis unusually dense (rho_0 ~ 0.1, M_sun pc^{-3}) and compact (R_core approx 1\nkpc). The neutral gas component, with mass M_g = 1.27x10^9 M_sun is probably\nmore massive than the stellar component. Split and broad HI lines (line of\nsight velocity dispersion, sigma ~ 35 km/s) are seen in the central region.\nPressure support is probably significant, and it is not clear whether the core\nis in equilibrium. Beyond the Holmberg radius, the average HI sigma is 8 km/s,\nwhich is normal for disk galaxies. NGC~2915 does not obey the Tully-Fisher\n(1977) relation, being underluminous by a factor of nine. A simple HI surface\ndensity threshold of about 10^{21} cm^{-2} adequately describes the location of\ncurrent star formation. The HI properties are compared to \"normal\" disk\ngalaxies and other BCDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jan 1996 16:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The effective action for the soliton position is shown to\ncontain a gauge potential due to the Berry phase and a damping term caused by\nthe interaction between soliton and spin waves. For temperatures below the\nanisotropy gap this dissipation reduces to a pure soliton mass renormalization.\nThe gauge potential strongly affects the quantum dynamics of the soliton in a\nperiodic lattice or pinning potential. For half-integer spin, destructive\ninterference between soliton states of opposite chirality suppresses nearest\nneighbor hopping. Thus the Brillouin zone is halved, and for small mixing of\nthe chiralities the dispersion reveals a surprising dynamical correlation: Two\nsubsequent band minima belong to different chirality states of the soliton.

In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in\nO(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the\nnetwork. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us\nto answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence\nabsorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in\napplications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic\ndatabases.
