Our previous work had shown that,\ndue to gravitational lensing, dipolar fields cannot reproduce the strong\npulsations observed in Vela, Geminga, PSR 0656+14, and PSR 1055-52. Assuming a\nstandard neutron star mass of 1.4 Msol, we show here that the inclusion of a\nquadrupolar component, if it is suitably oriented, is sufficient to increase\nsubstantially the pulsed fraction, Pf, up to, or above, the observed values if\nthe stellar radius is 13 km or even 10 km. For models with a radius of 7 km the\nmaximum pulsed fraction obtainable with (isotropic) blackbody emission is of\nthe order of 15% for orthogonal rotators (Vela, Geminga and PSR 1055-52) and\nonly 5% for an inclined rotator as PSR 0656+14. Given the observed values this\nindicates that the neutron stars in Geminga and PSR 0656+14 have radii\nsignificantly larger than 7 km and, given the very specific quadrupole\ncomponents required to increase Pf, even radii of the order of 10 km may be\nunlikely in all four cases.\n  We confirm our previous finding that the pulsed fraction always increases\nwith photon energy, below about 1 keV, when blackbody emission is used and show\nthat it is due to the hardenning of the blackbody spectrum with increasing\ntemperature. The observed decrease of pulsed fraction may thus suggest that the\nemitted spectrum softens with increasing temperature.\n  Finally, we apply our model to reassess the magnetic field effect on the\nouter boundary condition used in neutron star cooling models and show that, in\ncontradistinction to several previous claims, it is very small and most\nprobably results in a slight reduction of the heat flow through the envelope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Feb 1996 01:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

If a flaton field is trapped at the origin in the early\nuniverse, one expects `thermal inflation' to take place before it rolls away to\nthe true vacuum, because the finite-temperature correction to the potential\nwill hold it at the origin until the temperature falls below $1\\TeV$ or so.

The second part of the paper considers topological defects which may be\nproduced at the end of an era of thermal inflation. If the flaton fields\nassociated with the era are GUT higgs fields, then its end corresponds to the\nGUT phase transition. In that case monopoles (as well as GUT higgs particles)\nwill have to be diluted by a second era of thermal inflation. Such an era will\nnot affect the cosmology of GUT strings, for which the crucial parameter is the\nstring mass per unit length. Because of the flat Higgs potential, the GUT\nsymmetry breaking scale required for the strings to be a candidate for the\norigin of large scale structure and the cmb anisotropy is about three times\nbigger than usual, but given the uncertainties it is still compatible with the\none required by the unification of the Standard Model gauge couplings.

Here one gets Dirac particles and\nChern-Simons particles respectively. A relation with the field theory is\ndiscussed.
