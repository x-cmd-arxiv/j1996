The semi--continuity implies, in particular,\nthat the set of so-called ``wild algebras'' in any family is a countable union\nof closed subsets. A very exciting problem is whether it is actually closed,\nhence whether the set of tame algebras is open. However, together with the\nresults of a former paper of the authors the semi-continuity implies that tame\nis indeed an open property for curve singularities (commutative CM rings). An\nanalogous procedure leads to the semicontinuity of the number of parameters in\nother cases, like representations of finite dimensional algebras or finite\ndimensional bimodules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Feb 1996 14:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
