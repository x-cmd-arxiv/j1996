The self-consistently determined gravitational potential of\nthe system provides the optical surface brightness distribution of the galaxy,\nmatching the de Vaucouleurs R^1/4-law, if the sound speed in the gas, stellar\nvelocity dispersion, and velocity dispersion of dark matter are related so that\noptical and X-ray brightness profiles match each other.\n  The thermal equilibrium of the gas is described in the framework of a\none-zone model, which incorporates radiative cooling, stellar mass loss,\nsupernova heating, and mass sink due to local condensational instability. The\nsequence of saddle-node and saddle-connection bifurcations provides a\nfirst-order phase transition, which separates the stable hot phase in the\ncooling medium for a reasonably high efficiency of condensation and precludes\ncatastrophic cooling of the gas. The bifurcations occur naturally, due to the\nshape of the radiative cooling function, and this holds for a wide range of gas\nmetallicities. The one-zone model implies a scaling relation for the\nequilibrium stellar and gas densities, which allows a hydrostatic, thermally\nstable distribution for the hot isothermal coronal gas. The resulting model for\ngas recycling reproduces the basic optical and X-ray properties of relatively\nisolated giant elliptical galaxies with hot haloes. Implications for cD\ngalaxies in X-ray dominant clusters and groups are briefly discussed in the\ngeneral context of galaxy formation and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 1996 22:43:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
