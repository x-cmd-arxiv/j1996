For each system we\nobtain the Coulomb pseudopotential parameters entering the exact\ndiagonalization calculation by using the realistic subband wave function from a\nself-consistent electronic structure calculation within the local density\napproximation (LDA) for a range of electron densities. We compare our realistic\nLDA pseudopotential parameters with those from widely used simpler model\napproximations in order to estimate the accuracies of the latter. We also\ncalculate the overlap between the exact numerical ground state and the\nanalytical Laughlin state as well as the excitation gap as a function of\ndensity. For the three physical systems we consider the calculated overlap is\nfound to be large in the experimental electron density range. We compare our\ncalculated excitation gap energy to the experimentally obtained activated\ntransport energy gaps after subtracting out the effect of level broadening due\nto collisions. The agreement between our calculated excitation gaps and the\nexperimental measurements is excellent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Feb 1996 21:33:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
