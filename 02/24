We present CO(1-0) interferometer data of the bar and\ncircumnuclear region with 2.3 x 2.2 arcsec spatial resolution and 13 km/s\nvelocity resolution acquired at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory . These data\nreveal a clumpy circumnuclear ring of molecular gas. We also find a peak of CO\ninside the ring within 2 arcsec of the optical center that is not associated\nwith massive star formation. We construct a rotation curve from these CO\nkinematic data and the mass model of Combes et al. (1992). Using this rotation\ncurve, we have identified the location of orbital resonances in the galaxy.\nAssuming that the bar ends at corotation, the circumnuclear ring of star\nformation lies between two Inner Lindblad Resonances, while the nuclear stellar\nbar ends near the IILR. Deviations from circular motion are detected just\nbeyond the CO and H-alpha ring, where the dust lanes along the leading edge of\nthe bar intersect the nuclear ring. These non-circular motions along the minor\naxis correspond to radially inward streaming motions at speeds of 20 - 90 km/s\nand clearly show inflowing gas feeding an ILR ring. There are bright HII\nregions near the ends of this inflow region, perhaps indicating triggering of\nstar formation by the inflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Feb 1996 17:04:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The magnetic field decay of a pulsar may\nbe able to give us an answer. Since Cooper pairing of quarks occurs inside a\nsufficiently cold strange star, the strange stellar core is superconducting. In\norder to compensate the effect of rotation, different superconducting species\ninside a rotating strange star try to set up different values of London fields.\nThus, we have a frustrated system. Using Ginzburg-Landau formalism, I solved\nthe problem of rotating a superconducting strange star: Instead of setting up a\nglobal London field, vortex bundles carrying localized magnetic fields are\nformed. Moreover, the number density of vortex bundles is directly proportional\nto the angular speed of the star. Since it is energetically favorable for the\nvortex bundles to pin to magnetic flux tubes, the rotational dynamics and\nmagnetic evolution of a strange star are coupled together, leading to the\nmagnetic flux expulsion as the star slows down. I investigate this effect\nnumerically and find that the characteristic field decay time is much less than\n20~Myr in all reasonable parameter region. On the other hand, the\ncharacteristic magnetic field decay time for pulsars is $\\geq 20$~Myr.
