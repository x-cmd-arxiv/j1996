A new covariant algebraic approach, based\non taking into account a finite number of low-order covariant derivatives of\nthe background fields and neglecting all covariant derivatives of higher\norders, is proposed. It is shown that a set of covariant differential operators\ntogether with the background fields and their low-order derivatives generates a\nfinite dimensional Lie algebra. This algebraic structure can be used to present\nthe heat semigroup operator in the form of an average over the corresponding\nLie group. Closed covariant formulas for the heat kernel diagonal are obtained.\nThese formulas serve, in particular, as the generating functions for the whole\nsequence of the Hadamard-\\-Minakshisundaram-\\-De~Witt-\\-Seeley coefficients in\nall symmetric spaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Feb 1996 09:35:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
