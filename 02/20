In chapeter 2 we give all limit relation between\ndifferent classes of orthogonal polynomials listed in the Askey-scheme.\n  In chapter 3 we list the q-analogues of the polynomials in the Askey-scheme.\nWe give their definition, orthogonality relation, three term recurrence\nrelation and generating functions. In chapter 4 we give the limit relations\nbetween those basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. Finally in chapter 5\nwe point out how the `classical` hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of the\nAskey-scheme can be obtained from their q-analogues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Feb 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
