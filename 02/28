Particular emphasis is placed on screening in bilayer\nsuperconductors. Since any charge fluctuation with long range character in real\nspace is screened by the Coulomb interaction, the relevant fluctuations in a\nsingle layer case are induced between different parts of the Fermi surface. In\na single band $d$-wave superconductor the scattering at energy transfer twice\nthe maximum gap $\\Delta_{max}$ is dominated by those parts of the Fermi surface\nwhere $\\Delta^2({\\bf k})$ is largest. As a consequence, the fully symmetric\n($A_{1g}$) scattering is screened. In the case of a bilayer superconductor\nhowever, the charge transfer is possible between layers inside the unit cell.\nTherefore a formalism is considered which is valid for general band structure,\nsuperconducting energy gaps, and inter-layer hopping matrix elements. The\nspectra is calculated for La 2:1:4 and Y 1:2:3 as representative single and\nbilayer superconductors. The mixing term is found to be negligible and thus the\nresponse is well approximated by the sum of the contributions from the\nindividual bands. The theory imposes strong constraints on both the magnitude\nand symmetry of the energy gap for the bilayer cuprates, and indicates that a\nnearly identical energy gap of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ symmetry provides a best fit\nto the data. However, the $A_{1g}$ part of the spectrum depends sensitively on\nmany parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Feb 1996 20:07:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 May 1996 00:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

For\n$k \\gg N$, this theory approaches topological Chern-Simons theory with no\nYang-Mills term, and expectation values of multiple Wilson loops yield Jones\npolynomials, as Witten has shown; it can be treated semiclassically. For $k=0$,\nthe theory is badly infrared singular in perturbation theory, a\nnon-perturbative mass and subsequent quantum solitons are generated, and Wilson\nloops show an area law. We argue that there is a phase transition between these\ntwo behaviors at a critical value of $k$, called $k_c$, with $k_c/N \\approx 2\n\\pm .7$. Three lines of evidence are given: First, a gauge-invariant one-loop\ncalculation shows that the perturbative theory has tachyonic problems if $k\n\\leq 29N/12$.The theory becomes sensible only if there is an additional dynamic\nsource of gauge-boson mass, just as in the $k=0$ case. Second, we study in a\nrough approximation the free energy and show that for $k \\leq k_c$ there is a\nnon-trivial vacuum condensate driven by soliton entropy and driving a\ngauge-boson dynamical mass $M$, while both the condensate and $M$ vanish for $k\n\\geq k_c$. Third, we study possible quantum solitons stemming from an effective\naction having both a Chern-Simons mass $m$ and a (gauge-invariant) dynamical\nmass $M$. We show that if $M \\gsim 0.5 m$, there are finite-action quantum\nsphalerons, while none survive in the classical limit $M=0$, as shown earlier\nby D'Hoker and Vinet.

The \"standard\" R-matrix was shown to be the unique solution of a very\nsimple, linear recursion relation and the classical limit was obtained in the\ncase of quantized Kac-Moody algebras of finite type. Here the standard R-matrix\nfor generalized quantum groups is first examined in the case of quantized\naffine Kac-Moody algebras. The classical limit yields the standard affine\nr-matrices of Belavin and Drinfeld. Then, turning to the general case, we study\nthe exact deformations of the standard R-matrix and the associated Hopf\nalgebras. They are described as a generalized twist, $ R_\\epsilon =\n(F^t)^{-1}RF$, where $R$ is the standard R-matrix and $F$ (a power series in\nthe deformation parameter $\\epsilon$) is the solution of a linear recursion\nrelation of the same type as that which determines $R$. Specializing again, to\nthe case of quantized, affine Kac-Moody algebras, and taking the classical\nlimit of these esoteric quantum groups, one re-discovers the esoteric affine\nr-matrices of Belavin and Drinfeld, including the elliptic ones. The formulas\nobtained here are easier to use than the original ones, and the structure of\nthe space of classical r-matrices (for simple Lie algebras) is more tranparent.\nIn addition, the r-matrices obtained here are more general in that they are\ndefined on the central extension of the loop groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Feb 1996 10:51:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

One strategy takes for\ngranted the Principle of the Common Cause, which requires that a correlation\nbetween hidden variables and measurement settings be explained by a joint\ncorrelation with some unknown factor in their common past. The other strategy\nrejects the Principle of the Common Cause, and argues that the required\ncorrelation might be due to the known interaction between the object system and\nthe measuring device in their common future. Bell and most others who have\ndiscussed these issues have focussed on the former strategy, but because the\ntwo approaches have not been properly distinguished, it has not been well\nappreciated that there is a quite different way to relax IA.
