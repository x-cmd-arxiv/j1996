An exponential PVDF yields the best fit to the $\\xi_s$\nmeasured from galaxy samples of different redshift surveys. We show that this\nexponential PVDF is not merely a fitting function but arises from well defined\ngravitational processes. Two ingredients conspire to yield a PVDF with a nearly\nexponential shape: (i) the number density $n(\\sigma)$ of systems with velocity\ndispersion $\\sigma$; (ii) the unrelaxed dynamical state of most galaxy systems.\nThe former ingredient determines the exponential tail and the latter the\ncentral peak of the PVDF. We compare the $\\xi_s$ measured on non-linear scales\nfrom galaxy samples of the CfA redshift surveys with different models of the\nPVDF convolved with the measured real-space correlation function. This\npreliminary comparison indicates that the agreement between model and\nobservations depends strongly on both the underlying cosmological model and the\ninternal dynamics of galaxy systems.
