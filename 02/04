While Sachs-Wolfe fluctuations give the dominant contribution on\nangular scales larger than about a few degrees, on intermediate scales the main\nr\\^ole is played by coherent oscillations in the baryon radiation plasma before\nrecombination. In standard cosmological models these oscillations lead to the\n`Doppler peaks' in the angular power spectrum. Inflation-based cold dark matter\nmodels predict the location of the first peak to be at $\\ell\\sim\n220/\\sqrt{\\Omega_0}$, with a height which is a few times the level of\nanisotropies at large scales. Here we focus on perturbations induced by global\ntextures. We find that the height of the first peak is reduced and is shifted\nto $\\ell\\sim 350$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 1996 17:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
