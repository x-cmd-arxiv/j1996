The upper bound of the lightest Higgs mass is\nanalysed systematically on the basis of the $CP$ violation in the minimal and\nthe next minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM and NMSSM). In the\nexplicit $CP$ violation case, the mass bound is large around $130 \\sim 160$ GeV\nin both models. In the spontaneous $CP$ violation case induced by the radiative\neffects, the lightest Higgs mass upper bound is about $52$ GeV and sum of two\nlight neutral Higgs should be around $O$(100 GeV) in the NMSSM in contrast to\nthe one in the MSSM which implies about 6 GeV. This model gives the interesting\npredictions for the neutron electric dipole moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Feb 1996 01:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
