In so doing, we generalize the Gutzwiller\napproximation. In that,we take account of the effect of the band degeneracy and\nthe Hund's-rule coupling in addition to the on-site repulsion. After the\ndiscussion on nickel, the condition for the incomplete ferromagnetism, observed\nin cobalt and iron, is argued. Phase diagrams, which show the interplay between\nthe band shape peculiarity and the Hund's-rule coupling, are given. It is found\nthat for the $3d$-transition metal systems, both of the Hund's-rule coupling\nand the special feature of the density of states are necessary to explain the\nitinerant ferromagnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Feb 1996 10:22:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

At low transport voltages the effect of an ``odd''\nquasiparticle in the island leads to a $2e$-periodic dependence of the current\non the gate charge. We evaluate the $I-V$ characteristic in the framework of a\nmodel which accounts for these effects as well as for the influence of the\nelectromagnetic environment. The good agreement between our model calculation\nand experimental results demonstrates the importance of coherent Cooper-pair\ntunneling and parity effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Feb 1996 16:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
