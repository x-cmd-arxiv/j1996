The\n${}^{3}$He-${}^{3}$H binding-energy difference is computed in a nonrelativistic\napproach using a realistic wave function. We find the ${}^{3}$He-${}^{3}$H\nbinding-energy difference very sensitive to the short-distance behavior of the\nnucleon-nucleon potential. We conclude that for the typically hard Bonn form\nfactors such models can not account for the observed binding-energy difference\nin the three-nucleon system. For the medium-mass region (A=15--41) the\nbinding-energy differences of mirror nuclei are computed using a relativistic\nmean-field approximation to the Walecka model. We obtain large binding-energy\ndifferences---of the order of several hundred keV---arising from the\npseudoscalar sector. Two effects are primarily responsible for this new\nfinding: a) the inclusion of isospin breaking in the pion-nucleon coupling\nconstant, and b) the in-medium enhancement of the small components of the\nbound-state wave functions.
