While such objects display a wide range of shapes\nand spins, the distributions of these properties depend only weakly on the\ncosmological context and on the initial spectrum of density fluctuations.

The assignment of a weight $q$ per connected component\nof meander translates into a bilinear form on the algebra, with a Gram matrix\nencoding the fine structure of meander numbers. Here, we calculate the\nassociated Gram determinant as a function of $q$, and make use of the\northogonalization process to derive alternative expressions for meander numbers\nas sums over correlated random walks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 1996 10:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

The\ntwo-point function has a diverging length scale associated with it. The\ncritical exponents are calculated and it is shown that all the standard scaling\nrelations apply. Next the full model is studied, in which all spin\nconfigurations are included. Many of the considerations for the toy model apply\nfor the full model, which also has a diverging geometric correlation length\nassociated with the transition to a branched polymer phase. Using a transfer\nfunction we show that the two-point and spin-spin correlation functions decay\nexponentially with distance.
