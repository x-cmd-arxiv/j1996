Physical parameters are chosen such as to\nmodel the alleged binary precursors of barium stars, whose chemical\npeculiarities are believed to result from the accretion of the wind from a\ncompanion formerly on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The binary system\nmodelled consists of a 3 solar masses AGB star on the main sequence, in a 3AU\ncircular orbit. Three-dimensional simulations are performed for gases with\npolytropic indices gamma=1, 1.1 and 1.5, to bracket more realistic situations\nthat would include radiative cooling. Mass accretion rates are found to depend\non resolution and we estimate typical values of 1-2% for the gamma=1.5 case and\n8% for the other models. The highest resolution obtained (with 400k particles)\ncorresponds to an accretor of linear size 16 solar radii. Despite being (in the\ngamma = 1.5 case) about ten times smaller than theoretical estimates based on\nthe Bondi-Hoyle prescription, the SPH accretion rates remain large enough to\nexplain the pollution of barium stars. Uncertainties in the current SPH rates\nremain however, due to the simplified treatment of the wind acceleration\nmechanism, as well as to the absence of any cooling prescription and to the\nlimited numerical resolution. Angular momentum transfer leads to significant\nspin up of the accretor and can account for the rapid rotation of HD165141, a\nbarium star with a young white dwarf companion and a rotation rate unusually\nlarge among K giants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Feb 1996 16:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

We consider the effects of varying the definition of a\ncluster, the mean number density (or equivalently the richness) in a catalogue,\nand the assumed normalisation of the model; we also examine the importance of\nredshift space distortions. We implement five different group-finding\nalgorithms and construct cluster catalogues defined by mass, velocity\ndispersion or a measure of X-ray luminosity.

For such a system there is at high temperatures an approximate\nscaling of global properties like the end-to-end distance and the interaction\nenergy with the chain-length divided by the temperature. This scaling is broken\nat low temperatures by the ultraviolet divergence of the Coulomb potential. By\nintroducing a renormalization of the strength of the nearest- neighbour\ninteraction the scaling is restored, making possible an efficient blocking\nmethod for emulating very large polyelectrolytes using small systems. The high\ntemperature behaviour is well reproduced by the analytical high-$T$ expansions\neven for fairly low temperatures and system sizes. In addition, results from\nlow-$T$ expansions, where the coefficients have been computed numerically, are\npresented. These results approximate well the corresponding Monte Carlo results\nat realistic temperatures. A corresponding analysis of screened chains is\nperformed. The situation here is complicated by the appearance of an additional\nparameter, the screening length. A window is found in parameter space, where\nscaling holds for the end-to-end distance. This window corresponds to\nsituations where the range of the potential interpolates between the bond\nlength and the size of the chain. This scaling behaviour, which is verified by\nMonte Carlo results, is consistent with Flory scaling. Also for the screened\nchain a blocking approach can be devised, that performs well for low\ntemperatures, whereas the low-$T$ expansion is inaccurate at realistic\ntemperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 1996 13:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}

Earlier work on the subject, which traced back the quantum qroup\nsymmetry of the model to the Lie-Poisson symmetry of the chiral symplectic\nform, left some open questions: - How to reconcile the monodromy invariance of\nthe local 2D group valued field (i.e., equality of the left and right\nmonodromies) with the fact that the latter obey different exchange relations? -\nWhat is the status of the quantum group symmetry in the 2D theory in which the\nchiral fields commute? - Is there a consistent operator formalism in the chiral\nand in the extended 2D theory in the continuum limit? We propose a constructive\naffirmative answer to these questions for G=SU(2) by presenting the chiral\nquantum fields as sums of chiral vertex operators and q-Bose creation and\nannihilation operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Feb 1996 13:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
