This is the largest eccentricity of any planetary system discovered so\nfar. Assuming that 16 Cygni B has a mass of 1.0 Msun, this implies a mass for\nthe companion of 1.5 sin i Jupiter masses. While the mass of this object is\nwell within the range expected for planets, the large orbital eccentricity\ncannot be explained simply by the standard model of growth of planets in a\nprotostellar disk. It is possible that this object was formed in the normal\nmanner with a low eccentricity orbit, and has undergone post-formational\norbital evolution, either through the same process which formed the ``massive\neccentric'' planets around 70 Virginis and HD114762, or by gravitational\ninteractions with the companion star 16 Cygni A. It is also possible that the\nobject is an extremely low mass brown dwarf, formed through fragmentation of\nthe collapsing protostar.

It would be interesting to develop a\ngeneral theory of these constrained random matrices, which presumably play an\ninteresting role for many non-integrable problems related to diffusion. We\npresent a first step in this direction, namely a rigorous bound on the tail of\nthe eigenvalue distribution of such objects based on large deviation and\ngraphical estimates. This bound allows to prove regularity and decay properties\nof the averaged Green's functions and the density of states for a three\ndimensional model with a thin conducting band and an energy close to the border\nof the band, for sufficiently small coupling constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 1996 12:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

On\nthe contrary, the approximate symmetry properties of the hadron spectrum at low\nenergies, usually classified by `appropriately' broken compact flavour groups,\nemerge very naturally as a low energy reduction of the noncompact (dynamical)\nsymmetry group Sl(2,H).
