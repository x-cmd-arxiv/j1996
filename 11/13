For each\nmodel we run several realizations, on which we estimate cosmic variance\neffects. We analyse correlation statistics, the probability density function,\nand supercluster properties from percolation analysis. As a general result, we\nfind that the distribution of galaxy clusters provides a constraint only on the\nshape of the power spectrum, but not on its amplitude: a shape parameter 0.18 <\n\\Gamma < 0.25 and an effective spectral index at 20Mpc/h in the range\n[-1.1,-0.9] are required by the Abell/ACO data. In order to obtain\ncomplementary constraints on the spectrum amplitude, we consider the cluster\nabundance as estimated using the Press--Schechter approach, whose reliability\nis explicitly tested against N--body simulations. We conclude that, of the\ncosmological models considered here, the only viable models are either Cold+Hot\nDM ones with \\Omega_\\nu = [0.2-0.3], better if shared between two massive\nneutrinos, and flat low-density CDM models with \\Omega_0 = [0.3-0.5].\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 1996 13:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The theory\nis based heavily on concepts borrowed from machine learning and statistical\nestimation. In particular, learning takes place by fitting a stochastic,\ngenerative model of language to the evidence. Much of the thesis is devoted to\nexplaining conditions that must hold for this general learning strategy to\narrive at linguistically desirable grammars. The thesis introduces a variety of\ntechnical innovations, among them a common representation for evidence and\ngrammars, and a learning strategy that separates the ``content'' of linguistic\nparameters from their representation. Algorithms based on it suffer from few of\nthe search problems that have plagued other computational approaches to\nlanguage acquisition.\n  The theory has been tested on problems of learning vocabularies and grammars\nfrom unsegmented text and continuous speech, and mappings between sound and\nrepresentations of meaning. It performs extremely well on various objective\ncriteria, acquiring knowledge that causes it to assign almost exactly the same\nstructure to utterances as humans do.

The calculations are done with a SPH code using Newtonian gravity, and the\ngravitational radiation is calculated in the quadrupole limit. All models\ndevelop the global m=2 bar mode, with mass and angular momentum being shed from\nthe ends of the bar in two trailing spiral arms. The models then undergo\nsuccessive episodes of core recontraction and spiral arm ejection, with the\nnumber of these episodes increasing as n decreases: this results in\nlonger-lived gravitational wave signals for stiffer models. This instability\nmay operate in a stellar core that has expended its nuclear fuel and is\nprevented from further collapse due to centrifugal forces. The actual values of\nthe gravitational radiation amplitudes and frequencies depend sensitively on\nthe radius of the star R_{eq} at which the instability develops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 1996 21:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-11-19"}
