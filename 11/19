In practice, this problem is\noften circumvented by making ad hoc assumptions about the density distribution.\nHowever, one can redistribute the density and still project to the same surface\nbrightness. This is similar to adding so-called konus densities to the assumed\ndensity distribution. In this paper we investigate the maximum konus density\nthat one can add to elliptical galaxies. In particular we focus on the\nuncertainties in the central densities of axisymmetric, (cusped) elliptical\ngalaxies due to the non-uniqueness of the deprojection. In order to estimate\nthe dynamical influence of konus densities on the central region, we calculate\nthe mass fraction they can add to the center. We show that this mass fraction\nis at most a few percent. We also investigate the dynamical effect of cusped\nkonus densities We show that konus densities can only be moderately cusped, and\nthat an increase in cusp slope results in a decrease of the mass fraction added\nto the center by the konus density. We illustrate all this by the specific\nexample of M32, and show that the uncertainty in the central mass due to\ndeprojection is negligible compared to the inferred mass of the central black\nhole (BH) in this galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 Nov 1996 11:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

It may be considered as a result of the quantization of constants\nin the Racah-Wigner algebra for the Lie algebra $sl(2,C)$. The Racah-Wigner\nalgebra for the Sklyanin algebra is an example of the noncommutative weighted\nshift operator algebras (NWSO-algebras), which generalize the mho-algebras\nintroduced by the author earlier. If the Sklyanin algebra is interpreted as an\nalgebra of anomalous spins then the Racah-Wigner algebra for it may be regarded\nas an enlargement of the Sklyanin algebra by operators of the anomalous\nspin-spin interaction (of tensor type).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Nov 1996 23:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Although such optimism has been challenged by the\nrecent surprising discovery of the insecurity of the so-called quantum bit\ncommitment, the security of quantum two-party computation itself remains\nunaddressed. Here I answer this question directly by showing that all\n``one-sided'' two-party computations (which allow only one of the two parties\nto learn the result) are necessarily insecure. As corollaries to my results,\nquantum one-way oblivious password identification and the so-called quantum\none-out-of-two oblivious transfer are impossible.
