More\nimportantly, it appears to play a major role in the physics of the high-T_c\nsuperconductors, particularly since recent photoemission studies have found\nthat the VHS is close to the Fermi level in most of the high-T_c cuprates near\nthe composition of optimum T_c. This paper offers a comprehensive survey of the\nVHS model, describing both theoretical properties and experimental evidence for\nthe picture. Special topics discussed include a survey of the Fermi surfaces of\nthe cuprates and related compounds, and an analysis of the reliability of the\nslave boson approach to correlation effects.\n  While many properties of the cuprates can be qualitatively understood by a\nsimple rigid-band-filling model, this is inadequate for more quantitative\nresults, since correlation effects tend to pin the Fermi level near the VHS\nover an extended doping range, and can lead to a nanoscale phase separation.\nFurthermore, the peaks in the dos lead to competition from other instabilities,\nboth magnetic and structural (related to charge density waves). A novel form of\ndynamic structural instability, involving dynamic VHS-Jahn-Teller effects has\nbeen predicted. Scattered through the literature, there is considerable\nexperimental evidence for both nanoscale phase separation of holes, and for\nlocal, possibly dynamic, structural disorder. This review attempts to gather\nthese results into a comprehensive database, to sort the results, and to see\nhow they fit into the Van Hove scenario. Recent experiments on underdoped\ncuprates are found to provide a strong confirmation that the pseudogap is\ndriven by a splitting of the VHS degeneracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 Nov 1996 16:52:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

The local Langlands\nconjecture asserts the existence of a bijection between irreducible admissible\nrepresentations of GL(n,F) and n-dimensional admissible representations of the\nWeil-Deligne group of F. This bijection is required to satisfy certain natural\ncompatibilities, of which the most important is compatibility with local\nfunctional equations (preservation of L and epsilon factors of pairs). It is\nenough to construct a bijection with these properties between supercuspidal\nrepresentations of GL(n,F) and n-dimensional irreducible representations of the\nWeil group of F. In a previous paper, the author constructed a canonical\nbijection on the etale cohomology of the rigid-analytic coverings of the p-adic\nupper half space constructed by Drinfeld. (That the map in the previous paper\nis a bijection was actually proved by Henniart.) However, the compatibility of\nepsilon factors of pairs was not shown.

We take the assumption that all quantum bits\n(qubits) interact with the same environment rather than the assumption of\nseparate environments for different qubits. It is found that the qubits are\ndecohered collectively. For some kinds of entangled input states, no\ndecoherence occurs at all in the memory even if the qubits are interacting with\nthe environment. Based on this phenomenon, a scheme is proposed for reducing\nthe collective decoherence.
