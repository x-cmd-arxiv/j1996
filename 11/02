Contrary to\nwhat one would expect from dynamical systems theory, the splay state appears to\nbe neutrally stable for a wide range of system parameters. It has been\nexplained why the splay state must be neutrally stable when the\nStewart-McCumber parameter beta is zero. In this paper we complete the\nexplanation of the apparent neutral stability; we show that the splay state is\ntypically hyperbolic -- either asymptotically stable or unstable -- when beta >\n0. We conclude that there is only a single unit Floquet multiplier, based on\naccurate and systematic computations of the Floquet multipliers for beta\nranging from 0 to 10. However, N-2 multipliers are extremely close to 1 for\nbeta larger than about 1. In addition, two more Floquet multipliers approach 1\nas beta becomes large. We visualize the global dynamics responsible for these\nnearly degenerate multipliers, and then estimate them accurately by a multiple\ntime-scale analysis. For N=4 junctions the analysis also predicts that the\nsystem converges toward either the in-phase state, the splay state, or two\nclusters of two oscillators, depending on the parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 1996 18:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-30"}

Observations also provide\nstrong evidence that the B-star is rotating rapidly, perhaps at nearly its\nbreak up speed. We show that the dissipation of the dynamical tide in a star\nrotating in the same direction as the orbital motion of its companion (prograde\nrotation) with a speed greater than the orbital angular speed of the star at\nperiastron results in an increase in the orbital period of the binary system\nwith time. Thus, since the observed time derivative of the orbital period is\nlarge and negative, the B-star in the PSR J0045-7319 binary must have\nretrograde rotation if tidal effects are to account for the orbital decay. We\nalso show that the time scale for the synchronization of the B-star's spin with\nthe orbital angular speed of the star at periastron is comparable to the\norbital evolution time. From the work of Goldreich and Nicholson (1989) we\ntherefore expect that the B-star should be rotating differentially, with the\nouter layers rotating more slowly than the interior.

Since Li is likely to be depleted in stars of this type, the origin of\nthe Li is puzzling. Li has not been seen in similar secondaries of cataclysmic\nvariables, which suggests that the high Li abundance is not due to an anomalous\nsuppression of Li depletion in close binaries. SXTs in the quiescent state have\nhot advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) in which the ions are\nessentially at virial temperature.
