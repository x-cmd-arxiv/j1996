The\neffective equations governing the transport at scales large compared to those\nof the advecting flow are derived by using multi-scale techniques. Ballistic\ntransport generally takes place when both the solenoidal and the potential\ncomponents of the velocity do not vanish, despite of the fact that it has zero\naverage value. The calculation of the effective ballistic velocity $V_b$ is\nreduced to the solution of one auxiliary equation. An analytic expression for\n$V_b$ is derived in some special instances, i.e. flows depending on a single\ncoordinate, random with short correlation times and slightly compressible\ncellular flow. The effective mean velocity $V_b$ vanishes for velocity fields\nwhich are either incompressible or potential and time-independent. For generic\ncompressible flow, the most general conditions ensuring the absence of\nballistic transport are isotropy and/or parity invariance. When $V_b$ vanishes\n(or in the frame of reference moving with velocity $V_b$), standard diffusive\ntransport takes place. It is known that diffusion is always enhanced by\nincompressible flow. On the contrary, we show that diffusion is depleted in the\npresence of time-independent potential flow. Trapping effects due to potential\nwells are responsible for this depletion. For time-dependent potential flow or\ngeneric compressible flow, transport rates are enhanced or depleted depending\non the detailed structure of the velocity field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 Nov 1996 18:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Upon compactification of this superspace, a torsion is naturally\nintroduced and we produce the membrane and type IIB string actions in 11 and 10\ndimensional Minkowski spacetimes. In addition, the compactification of the\ntwelve dimensional supersymmetry algebra produces the correct algebras for\nthese theories, including central charges. These considerations thus give the\ntype IIB string and M-theory a single twelve dimensional origin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 1996 11:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Dec 1996 12:52:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
