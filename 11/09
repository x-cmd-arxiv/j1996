The calculations covering the entire main sequence evolution for\ninitial masses M_i=20 - 120 Msun (O3-B0 stars of all luminosity classes) are\nused for a systematic study of the ionizing fluxes of O and early B stars. We\ndemonstrate the importance of accounting simultaneously for non-LTE effects,\nline blanketing and stellar winds. The main results from our spectra are the\nfollowing: (1) The flux in the HeII continuum is increased by 2 to 3 (3 to 6)\norders of magnitudes compared to predictions from plane parallel non-LTE (LTE)\nmodel atmospheres. (2) The flux in the HeI continuum is increased due to\nnon-LTE effects. However, we find that it is also influenced by wind effects.\nThe combined effect of a mass outflow and line blanketing leads to a flatter\nenergy distribution in the HeI continuum, which confirms the results of\nSellmaier et al. (1996) for a wider range of stellar parameters. (3) The flux\nin the Lyman continuum is also modified due to line blanketing and the presence\nof a stellar winds, although to a lesser degree than the spectrum at higher\nenergies. We derive revised ionizing fluxes for O3 to B0 stars based on the\nrecent Teff and gravity calibrations of Vacca et al. (1996). The total number\nof Lyman continuum photons is found to be slightly lower than previous\nderivations. Due to the increased flux in the HeI continuum the hardness ratio\nof the HeI to H continuum is increased by 1.6 to 2.5 depending on spectral type\nand luminosity class. A critical discussion of current model assumptions shows\nthat for stars of types later than B0, having weak stellar winds, reliable\npredictions of ionizing fluxes are not yet possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Nov 1996 16:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

When approaching the ballistic\nregime, the limitation of the conductance due to the contact resistance becomes\nessential and expresses itself in a deviation from the above proportionality.\nHowever, in both regimes and for all system sizes the same proportionality is\nrecovered when the contact resistance is subtracted from the inverse\nconductance, showing that the ``curvatures measure the conductance in the\nbulk''.

It is shown that: i)\nusing different RG's can lead to complementary information, i.e. what is very\ndifficult to calculate with an RG based on one flow parameter may be much more\naccessible using another; ii) using more than one RG requires less physical\ninput in order to describe via RG methods the theory as a function of its\nparameters; iii) using more than one RG allows one to solve problems with more\nthan one diverging length scale. The above points are illustrated concretely in\nthe context of both particle physics and statistical physics using the\ntechniques of environmentally friendly renormalization. Specifically, finite\ntemperature $\\lambda\\phi^4$ theory, an Ising-type system in a film geometry, an\nIsing-type system in a transverse magnetic field, the QCD coupling constant at\nfinite temperature and the crossover between bulk and surface critical\nbehaviour in a semi-infinite geometry are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 1996 01:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-04-15"}

The results generalize the\nrelation between ALE spaces and moduli spaces of SU(n) and SO(2n) instantons.\nWe interpret some of these results from the string theory viewpoint, for SU(n)\nby analyzing T-duality and extremal transitions in type II string\ncompactifications, for SO(2n) by using D-branes as probes.
