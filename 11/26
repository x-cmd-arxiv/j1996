This\nlimit, and other simplifying assumptions, have allowed the derivation of\nseveral simple results characterizing the onset of environmentally induced\nsuperselection; but these results are increasingly often regarded as a complete\nphenomenological characterization of decoherence in any regime. This is not\nnecessarily the case: The examples presented in this paper counteract this\nimpression by violating several of the simple ``rules of thumb''. This is\nrelevant because decoherence is now beginning to be tested experimentally, and\none may anticipate that, in at least some of the proposed applications (e.g.,\nquantum computers), only the basic principle of ``monitoring by the\nenvironment'' will survive. The phenomenology of decoherence may turn out to be\nsignificantly different.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 1996 20:30:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The latter may be\nreduced, but not eliminated, by means of symmetrization, namely by using many\nreplicas of the computer, and forcing their joint quantum state to be\ncompletely symmetric. On the other hand, isolated errors can be corrected by\nquantum codewords that represent a logical qubit in a redundant way, by several\nphysical qubits. If one of the physical qubits is perturbed, for example if it\ngets entangled with an unknown environment, there still is enough information\nencoded in the other physical qubits to restore the logical qubit, and\ndisentangle it from the environment. The recovery procedure may consist of\nunitary operations, without the need of actually identifying the error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Nov 1996 00:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
