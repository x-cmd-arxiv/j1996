It has been one of the major challenges of\nexperimental nuclear astrophysics to assess the magnitude of these cross\nsections in the laboratory. For a successful experiment high luminosity beams\nare needed. Increasing the target width, one also increases the reaction\nyields. But, this is of limited use due to multiple scattering in the target.\nStorage rings are a very good way to overcome these difficulties. In principle,\nthey can be tuned to large luminosities, and have the advantage of crossing the\ninteraction region many times per second (typically one million/s),\ncompensating low density internal gas targets, or low reaction rates in\nbeam-beam collisions. Storage rings are also ideal tools for precise\nmeasurements of masses and beta-decay lifetimes of nuclei of relevance for\nastrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 1996 16:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Collective expansion of the source leads to a dependence of the\ntwo-particle correlation function on the pair momentum K. This opens the\npossibility to reconstruct the dynamics of the source from the K-dependence of\nthe measured HBT radii. Here we address the question to what extent resonance\ndecays can fake such a flow signal. Within a simple parametrization for the\nemission function we present a comprehensive analysis of the interplay of flow\nand resonance decays on the one- and two-particle spectra. We discuss in detail\nthe non-Gaussian features of the correlation function introduced by long-lived\nresonances and the resulting problems in extracting meaningful HBT radii. We\npropose to define them in terms of the second order q-moments of the correlator\nC(q, K). We show that this yields a more reliable characterisation of the\ncorrelator in terms of its width and the correlation strength `lambda' than\nother commonly used fit procedures. The normalized fourth-order q-moments\n(kurtosis) provide a quantitative measure for the non-Gaussian features of the\ncorrelator. At least for the class of models studied here, the kurtosis helps\nseparating effects from expansion flow and resonance decays, and provides the\ncleanest signal to distinguish between scenarios with and without transverse\nflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 1996 11:29:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jan 1998 13:22:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
