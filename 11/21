Our main goal was to see if there is a difference\nin the elemental abundances of active stars between young and more evolved\nobjects. A two temperature plasma with subsolar abundances, of the order of Z =\n0.15 - 0.3, is required to fit the SIS spectra. Similar results are obtained\nfrom a ROSAT PSPC observation. Metal abundances of 0.2 - 0.4 the solar value\nare required to fit both the ASCA and ROSAT data together. From a simultaneous\nSIS0+SIS1 spectral fit, with 2T plasma models and abundances free to vary in\nnon-solar proportions, we find that, besides N, O and Ne for which we find very\nlow values, all other elements have values relative to solar abundances around\n0.2-0.3. These subsolar abundances are in line with those typically observed in\nmore evolved, active stars like RS CVn and Algol-type binaries. The two\ntemperature values required to fit the ASCA SIS spectra are about 0.5 and 1.0\nkeV. These temperatures, especially the higher one, are lower with respect to\nthe values found for the RS CVn and Algol binaries or for the young star AB\nDor, but higher than other single G/K stars. All our data show that this\nsingle, late F-type star is actually a very active source, indirectly\nconfirming that this fast rotating star is probably a young object. In the\nsimultaneous fit of the ASCA+ROSAT data, a third temperature is required.\nHowever this is not just an addition of a softer component, but is more a\nredistribution of the dominant temperatures. Indeed, the range spanned by the\nthree temperatures, from 5 to 15 million degrees, is not very large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 1996 17:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

For p + Be reactions the\ndilepton yield for invariant masses $M \\leq 1.4$ GeV is found to be dominated\nby the decays of the $\\eta, \\rho, \\omega$ and $\\Phi$ mesons at all energies\nfrom 10 -- 450 GeV. For nucleus-nucleus collisions, however, the dilepton yield\nshows an additional large contribution from $\\pi^+\\pi^-$, $K^+K^-$ and $\\pi\n\\rho$ channels. Systematic studies are presented for the 'free' meson mass\nscenario in comparison to a 'dropping' meson mass scenario at finite baryon\ndensity. We find that for 'dropping' meson masses the invariant dilepton mass\nrange 0.35 GeV $\\leq M \\leq$ 0.65 GeV is increased in comparison to the 'free'\nmeson mass scenario and that the data of the CERES-collaboration for\nnucleus-nucleus collisions can be described much better within the 'dropping'\nmass scheme. We study in detail the contributions from the various dilepton\nchannels as a function of the transverse momentum and rapidity of the lepton\npair as well as a function of the charged particle multiplicity. Furthermore,\nvarious direct photon channels for S + Au at 200 GeV/u are computed and found\nto be well below the upper bounds measured by the WA80-collaboration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Nov 1996 16:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 May 1997 15:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-19"}
