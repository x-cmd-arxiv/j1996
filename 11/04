In April 1985 GX 339-4 was in\na weak low state (0.03E-9 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1}, 2 - 10 keV). The X-ray spectrum\nwas a hard power law with a photon index \\alpha of 1.82 and the power spectrum,\nthough ill-constrained by the data, was consistent with a typical BHC low state\nspectrum. During the other three pointings the system was brighter (1.5E-9 erg\ncm^{-2} s^{-1}, 2 - 10 keV), an ultrasoft component was present in the\nspectrum, and the power law was steeper (\\alpha ~3.5 in 1984; in 1983 it was\nnot well-measured); the power spectrum showed a flat-topped band-limited noise\ncomponent with a break frequency of ~4.5 Hz and a fractional rms amplitude of\n~7%.
