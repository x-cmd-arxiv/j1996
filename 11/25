These constraints are based on\nthe observation that the peak position of the interstellar UV feature is very\nstable (variations <~1%), that the large variations in width (<~25%) are\nuncorrelated with the peak position except for the widest bumps, and that the\nshape of the feature is described extremely well by a Drude profile. The UV\nextinction of small graphite grains is computed for various clustering models\ninvolving Rayleigh spheres. It is shown that compact clusters qualitatively\nsatisfy the above observational constraints, except that the peak position\nfalls at the wrong wavelength. As an alternative to graphite to model the\noptical properties of the interstellar UV feature carrier, a single-Lorentz\noscillator model is considered, in conjunction with a clustering model based on\nclusters of spheres. Intrinsic changes in the peak position and width are\nattributed to variations in chemical composition of the grains, impacting upon\nthe parameters of the Lorentz oscillator. Further broadening is attributed to\nclustering. These models are shown to satisfy the above observational\nconstraints. Furthermore, the correlated shift of peak position with increased\nwidth, observed for the widest interstellar UV features, is reproduced. Models\ninvolving a second Lorentz oscillator to reproduce the FUV rise are also\nconsidered. The impact of this extra Lorentz oscillator on the peak position,\nwidth, and shape of the bump is investigated. Synthetic extinction curves are\ngenerated to model actual ones exhibiting a wide range of FUV curvatures.\nPhysical mechanisms which might be of relevance to explain the variations of\nthese optical properties are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 1996 15:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Alternatively, localization problem is obtained if the\nnoise auto-correlation time is taken to be infinite.

Fascinating non-Markovian effects due to time-correlated\n(colored) noise are explored. For this, a new strategy is developed in order to\nhandle the integration over paths.

As a\nstrategy, we first work out the constraints and then quantize, replacing the\nDirac brackets with quantum commutators. We find that the Chern-Simons field\ntheories become two dimensional models with no propagation along the time\ndirection. Moreover, we prove that, despite of the presence of non-trivial\nself-interactions in the gauge fixed functional, the commutation relations\nbetween the fields are trivial at any order in perturbation theory in the\nabsence of couplings with matter fields. If these couplings are present,\ninstead, the commutation relations become rather involved, but it is still\npossible to study their main properties and to show that they vanish at the\ntree level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 1996 15:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Both are considered with and without initial quark gluon plasma\nformation. In each case the initial temperature is fixed by requiring\n$dN_{ch}/dy \\sim$ 550 in the final state. It is shown that most observables are\nvery sensitive to the equation of state. This is particularly evident when\ncomparing the results of the simplified equation of state in the scenarios with\nand without phase transition. The hadronic gas scenario leads to a\nsubstantially higher rate for the $p_T$-distribution of all particles. In the\ncomplete equation of state with several hundreds of hadronic resonances, the\ndifference between the scenarios with and without phase transition is rather\nmodest. Both photon and particle spectra, in a wide $p_T$ range, show very\nsimilar behavior. It is therefore concluded that from the $p_T$ spectra it will\nbe hard to disentangle quark gluon plasma formation in the initial state. It is\nto be stressed however, that there are conceptual difficulties in applying a\npure hadronic gas equation of state at SPS-energies. The phase transition\nscenario with a quark gluon plasma present in the initial state seems to be the\nmore natural one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 Nov 1996 22:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
