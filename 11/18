We note that the temporal chaotic properties of the original\ncontinuum gauge fields and the lattice gauge system have entirely different\nscaling properties thereby emphasizing that they are entirely different\ndynamical systems which have only very little in common. Considered as a\nstatistical system in its own right the lattice gauge system in a situation\nwhere it has reached equilibrium comes closest to what could be termed a\n``continuum limit'' in the limit of very small energies (weak non-linearities).\nWe discuss the lattice system both in the limit for small energies and in the\nlimit of high energies where we show that there is a saturation of the temporal\nchaos as a pure lattice artifact. Our discussion focuses not only on the\ntemporal correlations but to a large extent also on the spatial correlations in\nthe lattice system. We argue that various conclusions of physics have been\nbased on monitoring the non-Abelian lattice system in regimes where the fields\nare correlated over few lattice units only. This is further evidenced by\ncomparison with results for Abelian lattice gauge theory.
