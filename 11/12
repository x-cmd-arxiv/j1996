The noisy, non-linear term is a unimodular scalar\nmultiple of the time reversal operator that must be present whenever a\nHamiltonian term in the Schrodinger equation can distinguish the factorized\nconstituents of an entangled state. The dynamical mechanism involved in the\ntransformation of entangled into factorized states provides an explanation for\nthe fact that Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen correlations appear in a time determined\nby the response of the measuring device and independent of the distance between\nthe particles. The dependence on the response time of the measuring device may\nbe testable through a delay in observing the collapse of mesoscopic\n``Schrodinger cat\" states in ion traps. It is further shown that there are\nsituations where a two-particle interaction can induce a non-linear term by\nvirtue of coupling to decay modes that distinguish factorized constituents of\nan entangled state. We show that this should happen in the neutral K-meson\nsystem where the entangled $K_L$ state is pushed slightly in the direction of a\nfactorized constituent ($K_o$ or $\\overline{K_o}$) as a consequence of the fact\nthat these can be distinguished via the sign of the charged lepton in a\nsemi-leptonic decay mode. The result is a CP violation that is within 20% of\nthe experimental value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 Nov 1996 02:57:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
