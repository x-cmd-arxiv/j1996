The key mistake is to require\nthat the heavy quark pair forms a color singlet at short distances, given that\nthere is an infinite time for soft gluons to readjust the color of the $c \\bar\nc$ pair before it appears as an asymptotic $\\psi$ or, alternatively, $D \\bar D$\nstate. We suspect that the same mistake is made in the description of rapidity\ngaps, i.e.\\ the production of a color-neutral quark-antiquark pair, in terms of\nthe exchange of a color neutral gluon pair. The $\\psi$ is after all a color\nneutral $c \\bar c$ pair and we will show that it is produced by the same\ndynamics as $D \\bar D$ pairs; its color happens to be bleached by soft\nfinal-state interactions. This approach to color is suggestive of the\nunorthodox prescription for the production of rapidity gaps in deep inelastic\nscattering, proposed by Buchm\\\"uller and Hebecker. When applied to the\nformation of gaps between a pair of high transverse momentum jets in hadron\ncollisions, the soft color approach suggests a formation rate of gaps in\ngluon-gluon subprocesses which is similar or smaller than in quark-quark\ninduced events. Formation of gaps should increase when increasing transverse\nmomentum or lowering energy, in contrast with 2-gluon exchange Pomeron models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Nov 1996 20:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
