The concepts of higher order space, or locally\nanisotropic, space (in brief, h-space, or la-space) are introduced as general\nones for various types of higher order extensions of Lagrange and Finsler\ngeometry and higher dimension (Kaluza-Klein type) spaces. The spinors on\nh-spaces are defined in the framework of the geometry of Clifford bundles\nprovided with compatible nonlinear and distinguished connections and metric\nstructures (d-connection and d-metric). There are discussed some related issues\nconnected with the geometric aspects of higher order anisotropc interactions\nfor gravitational, gauge, spinor, Dirac spinor and Proca fields. The nearly\nautoparallel maps are introduced as maps with deformation of connections\nextending the class of geodesic and conformal transforms. We propose two\nvariants of solution of the problem of definition of conservation laws on\nh-spaces. A general background of the theory of field interactions and strings\nin spaces with higher order anisotropy is fromulated. The conditions for\nconsistent propagation of closed strings in higher order anisotropic background\nspaces are analyzed. The connection between the conformal invariance, the\nvanishing of the renormalization group beta-function of the generalized\nsigma-model and field equations of higher order anisotropic gravity are studied\nin detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 Nov 1996 17:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
