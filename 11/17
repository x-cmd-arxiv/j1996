As an application, we give a geometric proof of the\ntheorem of Kraskiewicz and Pragacz that Schubert polynomials are characters of\nSchubert modules.\n  Our work leads on the one hand to a Demazure character formula for Schubert\npolynomials and other generalized Schur functions, and on the other hand to a\nStandard Monomial Theory for Bott-Samelson varieties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Nov 1996 18:18:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The amplitude of one line\nmore than doubled in about 10 minutes. The intensity changes cannot be\nattributed easily to a mechanism of intrinsic fluctuations. The variability may\nbe the result of strong interstellar diffractive scintillation along the line\nof sight within our Galaxy, which would be the first example of diffractive\nscintillation for any source at 22 GHz and for any source other than a pulsar.\nHowever, only the very shortest timescales for interstellar scintillation,\nobtained from pulsar observations and scaled to 22 GHz, correspond to the\nobserved maser variability. Alternatively, the intensity changes may be a\nreaction to fluctuations in compact background or radiative pump sources and\nthereby may be related to variability of the central engine. The maser spectral\nfeatures symmetrically bracket the systemic velocity of the galaxy, offset by\nabout +/-(100-200) km/s. The spectrum of the Circinus maser is similar in some\nrespects to that of the maser in NGC 4258, which probably traces a molecular\ndisk rotating around a supermassive object.

The procedure is based,\nas before, on an exponential central star mass distribution, on H-burning\npost-AGB evolutionary tracks, and on the avoidance of nebular models for the\ncalculation of nebular fluxes. We have added new post-AGB evolutionary tracks\nand introduced the following improvements: (1) the imperfect analytical\nrepresentation of post-AGB evolutionary tracks has been replaced by an\ninterpolation routine giving a better approximation; (2) we have modified the\ndistribution of the intensities of [O III] lambda 5007 relative to Hbeta, so\nthat it better imitates the observed distribution, which we have taken from\ndata in the Strasbourg-ESO catalogue of Galactic PNs and other sources; (3) we\nhave adjusted the absorbing factor mu along the white dwarf cooling tracks, so\nas to reproduce the observed PNLF of the Magellanic Clouds and M 31 at fainter\nmagnitudes. In this way we have produced a PNLF which is more consistent with\nobserved PN properties. We use this randomly generated PNLF to: (1) show as\nconvincingly as possible that most PNs in any real population must leak stellar\nH-ionizing photons; (2) revise our determinations of the parameter mu(max); (3)\ndiscuss the shape of the PNLF, hinting at the possible existence of a distinct\nfeature 2 magnitudes fainter than the brightest PNs; (4) attempt estimates of\nmaximum final masses from fits to the PNLFs of the LMC and M 31. There is\nmarginal evidence of a higher maximum final mass in the LMC, but this should be\nconfirmed in other galaxies with recent star formation. A convincing\nconfirmation will require to increase the sample sizes and to extend the PNLFs\nto at least 1.5 mag fainter than the brightest PNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 1996 15:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We establish\nthat the shorter periodicity is the orbital period of the underlying binary\nsystem. The longer period oscillates with an average value of |dot(P)| ~\n3x10^(7)--typical to permanent superhumps. The two periods obey the linear\nrelation between the orbital and superhump periods that holds among members of\nthe SU Ursae Majoris class of dwarf novae. A third periodicity of 0.083204\nd~2.00 hr appeared in 1994 but not in 1995. It may be related to the recently\ndiscovered anti-superhump phenomenon. These results suggest a linkage between\nthe classical nova V1974 Cyg and the SU UMa stars, and indicate the existence\nof an accretion disk and permanent superhumps in the system no later than 30\nmonths after the nova outburst. From the precessing disk model of the superhump\nphenomenon we estimate that the mass ratio in the binary system is between 2.2\nand 3.6.

As a\nconsequence of such a choice of the measure, the matter Lagrangian $L_{m}$ can\nbe changed by adding a constant while no cosmological term is induced. Here we\ndevelop this idea to build a new theory which is formulated through the first\norder formalism, i.e. using vielbein $e_{a}^{\\mu}$ and spin connection\n$\\omega_{\\mu}^{ab}$ (a,b=1,2,...D) as independent variables. The equations\nobtained from the variation of $e_{a}^{\\mu}$ and the fields $\\phi_{a}$ imply\nthe existence of a nontrivial constraint. This approach can be made consistent\nwith invariance under arbitrary diffeomorphisms in the internal space of scalar\nfields $\\phi_{a}$ (as well as in ordinary space-time), provided that the matter\nmodel is chosen so as to satisfy the above mentioned constraint. If the matter\nmodel is not chosen so as to satisfy automatically this constraint, the\ndiffeomorphism invariance in the internal space is broken. In this case the\nconstraint is dynamically implemented by the degrees of freedom that become\nphysical due to the breaking of the internal diffeomorphism invariance.\nHowever, this constraint always dictates the vanishing of the cosmological\nconstant term and the gravitational equations in the vacuum coincide with\nvacuum Einstein's equations with zero cosmological constant. The requirement\nthat the internal diffeomorphisms be a symmetry of the theory points towards\nthe unification of forces in nature like in the Kaluza-Klein scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Nov 1996 07:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}
