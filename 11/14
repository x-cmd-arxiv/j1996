The corresponding\nequation describing the evolution of schematas is found by performing an exact\ncoarse graining of this equation. In particular exact expressions for schemata\nreconstruction are derived which allows for a critical appraisal of the\n``building-block hypothesis'' of genetic algorithms. A further coarse-graining\nis made by considering the contribution of all length-l schematas to the\nevolution of population observables such as fitness growth. As a test function\nfor investigating the emergence of structure in the evolution the increase per\ngeneration of the in-schemata fitness averaged over all schematas of length l,\n$\\Delta_l$, is introduced. In finding solutions of the evolution equations we\nconcentrate more on the effects of crossover, in particular we consider\ncrossover in the context of Kauffman Nk models with k=0,2. For k=0, with a\nrandom initial population, in the first step of evolution the contribution from\nschemata reconstruction is equal to that of schemata destruction leading to a\nscale invariant situation where the contribution to fitness of schematas of\nsize l is independent of l. This balance is broken in the next step of\nevolution leading to a situation where schematas that are either much larger or\nmuch smaller than half the string size dominate over those with $l \\approx\nN/2$. The balance between block destruction and reconstruction is also broken\nin a k>0 landscape. It is conjectured that the effective degrees of freedom for\nsuch landscapes are landscape connective trees that break down into effectively\nfit smaller blocks, and not the blocks themselves. Numerical simulations\nconfirm this ``connective tree hypothesis'' by showing that correlations drop\noff with connective distance and not with intrachromosomal distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 1996 19:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Moreover, PBH production requires several\nsigma (rare) fluctuations in order to prevent premature matter dominance of the\nuniverse, so we are necessarily concerned with distribution tails, where any\nintrinsic skewness will be especially important. We quantify this argument by\nusing the stochastic slow-roll equation and a relatively simple analytic method\nto obtain the final distribution of fluctuations.

We study both\nsituations in the case where quantum dissipation dominates over the inertia of\nthe vortices. We find that the vortex tunneling and nucleation rates have a\nvery rapid dependence on the current density driven through the sample.\nAccordingly, whilst normally the superconductor is essentially resistance-free,\nfor the high current densities that can be reached in high-$T_c$ films a\nmeasurable resistance might develop. We show that edge-tunneling appears\nfavoured, but the presence of pinning centres and of thermal fluctuations leads\nto an enhancement of the nucleation rates. In the case where a periodic pinning\npotential is artificially introduced in the sample, we show that\ncurrent-oscillations will develop indicating an effect specific to the\nnucleation mechanism where the vortex pair-production rate, thus the\nresistance, becomes sensitive to the corrugation of the pinning substrate.

If the probe pulses were strictly ideal measurements, the QZE\nwould predict periods of fluorescence bursts alternating with periods of no\nfluorescence (light and dark periods) which would become longer and longer with\nincreasing frequency of the measurements. The non-ideal character of the\nmeasurements is taken into account by incorporating the laser pulses in the\ninteraction, and this is used to determine the corrections to the ideal case.\nIn the limit, when the time between the laser pulses goes to zero, no freezing\noccurs but instead we show convergence to the familiar macroscopic light and\ndark periods of the continuously driven Dehmelt system. An experiment of this\ntype should be feasible for a single atom or ion in a trap\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Nov 1996 17:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

We improve this bound and\ndescribe fault tolerant quantum computation when the error probability is\nsmaller than some constant threshold. The cost is polylogarithmic in time and\nspace, and no measurements are used during the quantum computation. The result\nholds also for quantum circuits which operate on nearest neighbors only. To\nachieve this noise resistance, we use concatenated quantum error correcting\ncodes. The scheme presented is general, and works with all quantum codes that\nsatisfy some restrictions, namely that the code is ``proper''.\n  We present two explicit classes of proper quantum codes. The first example of\nproper quantum codes generalizes classical secret sharing with polynomials. The\nsecond uses a known class of quantum codes and converts it to a proper code.\nThis class is defined over a field with p elements, so the elementary quantum\nparticle is not a qubit but a ``qupit''. With our codes, the threshold is about\n10^(-6). Hopefully, this paper motivates a search for proper quantum codes with\nhigher thresholds, at which point quantum computation becomes practical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Nov 1996 11:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 1996 10:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
