The data\nreduction in such a crowded field was based on a wavelet transform analysis.\nOur larger dataset extends the previous results by Carney et al. (1991, AJ,\n101, 1699) for the outer and less crowded fields of the cluster, and confirms\nthat NGC 6229 has a peculiar color-magnitude diagram for its position in the\nGalaxy. In particular, NGC 6229's horizontal branch (HB) presents several\ninteresting features, among which stand out: a well populated and very extended\nblue tail; a rather blue overall morphology, with (B-R)/(B+V+R) = 0.24+/-0.02;\na bimodal color distribution, resembling those found for NGC 1851 and NGC 2808;\nand gaps on the blue HB. NGC 6229 is the first bimodal-HB cluster to be\nidentified in the Galactic outer halo. A low value of the R parameter is\nconfirmed, suggestive of a low helium abundance or of the presence of a quite\nsubstantial population of extreme HB stars fainter than our photometric limit\n(~ 2.5 mag below the RR Lyrae level in V). Twelve new possible variable stars\nwere found in the central part of the cluster. The morphology of the red giant\nbranch (RGB) also seems to be peculiar. In particular, the RGB luminosity\nfunction ``bump'' is not a prominent feature and has only been tentatively\nidentified, on the basis of a comparison with a previously reported detection\nfor M3 (NGC 5272). Finally, we compare the properties of NGC 6229 with those\nfor other outer-halo globular clusters, and call attention to what appears to\nbe a bimodal HB distribution for the outer-halo cluster population, where\nobjects with very red or very blue HB types are much more frequently found than\nclusters with intermediate HB types.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Nov 1996 17:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

With the weak\ncouplings used in this study the rates remain dominated by the pion-exchange\nmechanism since the contributions of heavier mesons either cancel each other or\nare suppressed by form factors and short-range correlations. The total decay\nrate therefore remains in agreement with present measurements. However, the\npartial rates which are even more sensitive to the inclusion of heavier mesons\ncannot be reconciled with the data.
