The corresponding gauge potential has the confining\nproperties. It is supposed that: a) the spherically symmetric solution is a\nfield distribution of the classical ``quark'' and in this sense it is similar\nto the Coulomb potential; b) the cylindrically symmetric solution describes a\nclassical field ``string'' (flux tube) between two ``quarks''. It is noticed\nthat these solutions are typically for the classical $SU(3)$ Yang - Mills\ntheory in contradiction to monopole that is an exceptional solution. This\nallows to conclude that the confining properties of the classical $SU(3)$ Yang\n- Mills theory are general properties of this theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Nov 1996 09:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
