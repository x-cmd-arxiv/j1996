At least three spectral components are required to fit the combined\nROSAT and ASCA spectrum in the 0.1--10 keV range. The observed X-ray flux in\nthis band is dominated by a hard Gamma = 1.7, heavily absorbed power law\ncomponent which originates in the nucleus and near-nuclear disk of the galaxy.\nAmong the candidates for the origin of this hard X-ray emission, the most\nplausible appears to be inverse-Compton scattered emission from the interaction\nof M82's copious infrared photon flux with supernova-generated relativistic\nelectrons. The measured intrinsic luminosity of the power law component agrees\nclosely with calculations of the expected inverse-Compton luminosity. Moreover,\nthe radio and X-ray emission in the nucleus of M82 have the same spectral\nslope, which should be the case if both types of emission are non- thermal and\nare associated with a common population of electrons. The other two spectral\ncomponents, thermal plasmas with characteristic temperatures kT = 0.6 and 0.3\nkeV, are associated with the star formation and starburst-driven wind in M82.\nThe warmer thermal component is heavily absorbed as well and must also\noriginate in the central region of the galaxy. The softer thermal component,\nhowever, is not absorbed, and is likely to represent the X-ray emission which\nextends along M82's minor axis.
