We show\nexplicitly that these three approaches lead to the same prediction in the limit\nof large squeezing (i.e. when the squeezing parameter $|r_k|\\to \\infty$): each\ntwo-modes quantum state (k, -k) of these perturbations is equivalent to a\nclassical perturbation that has a stochastic amplitude, obeying a non-gaussian\nstatistics which depends on the initial state, and that belongs to the\nquasi-isotropic mode (i.e. it possesses a fixed phase).
