This ideal frozen-in property of the magnetic field is broken in small\nvolumes if field gradients with different field polarity appear, in which\nlocalized dissipative effects, e.g. anomalous resistivity, become important. On\nthe base of X-ray measurements exhibiting a clear connection of infalling\nhigh-velocity clouds (HVC) with ROSAT \"hotspots\" we perform resistive\nmagnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the capabilities of magnetic\ndissipation as a major heating process in the interaction zone of the cloud\nwith the halo. The main result is that in the physical environment of a\ngalactic halo heating by externally driven magnetic reconnection cannot be\nsuppressed by thermal conduction and/or radiative cooling. Thus, the gas\nreaches the maximum temperature given by the magnetic field pressure in the\ninteraction zone of the HVC with the galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 1996 13:26:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The scientific impetus for\nsuch measurements is to construct internal velocity - luminosity relations at\nredshifts substantial enough to make cosmological and evolutionary tests.\nDepartures from a fiducial relation as a function of redshift are sensitive to\nboth space-time curvature and the evolution of the mass-to-light ratio in\ngalaxies. Because of this ambiguity -- curvature vs. evolution -- kinematics\nshould be viewed as a new cosmological tool at intermediate redshifts to be\ncombined with additional measurements. In particular, the apparent internal\nvelocities, colors, surface-brightness, and image shape are all unaffected by\ncurvature, so that this ensemble of observables can be used unambiguously to\nexplore galaxy evolution. Here we discuss a well-defined method of target\nselection which assures efficient measurement of spatially and spectrally\nresolved kinematics, namely rotation curves. Spatial resolution is critical\nsince it is difficult to use integrated line-widths to distinguish between, for\nexample, a low-mass star-forming galaxy and a high-mass galaxy with a central\nstar-burst.

Instead of familiar sign factors, the\nconstructions related to such \"N-complexes\" involve powers of q where q is a\nprimitive Nth root of 1. We show that the homology (in a natural sense) of an\nN-complex is an $(N-1)$-complex which is $(N-1)$-exact, and the role of the\nEuler characteristic is played by the trigonometric sum $\\sum q^i \\dim(C^i)$.\nBy q-deforming the de Rham differential we develop a version of the theory of\ndifferential forms which is coordinate-dependent but covariant with respect to\na natural Hopf algebra. In particular, there is a meaningful formalism of\nconnections with the curvature being an N-form given by the N th power of the\ncovariant derivative. For $N=3$ the expression for the curvature is very\nsimilar to the Chern-Simons functional.
