However,\nthis is not the case when shocks are involved.\n  For low values of c_s an open, off-axis shock flow forms that is\ncharacteristic for potentials with an inner Lindblad resonance (ILR). Through\nthis shock the gas streams inwards from x_1 to x_2-orbits. At high sound speeds\nthe gas arranges itself in a different, on-axis shock flow pattern.

The critical effective sound speed dividing the two\nregimes is in the range of values observed in the Milky Way.\n  We give a heuristic explanation for this effect.

The atoms are cooled and trapped\nat locations of purely circular polarization. The cooling process efficiently\naccumulates almost half of the atomic population in the lowest energy band\nwhich is only weakly coupled to the light field. Very low kinetic temperatures\nare obtained by adiabatically reducing the optical potential. The dynamics of\nthis process is analysed using a full quantum Monte Carlo simulation. The\ncalculations explicitly show the mapping of the band populations on the\ncorresponding momentum intervals of the free atom. In an experiment with\nsubrecoil momentum resolution we measure the band populations and find\nexcellent absolut agreement with the theoretical calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 1996 14:42:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This paper calculates deformations of standard quantum groups (with\nor without spectral parameter) in the category of quasi-Hopf algebras. An\nearlier investigation of the deformations of quantum groups, in the category of\nHopf algebras, showed that quantum groups are generically rigid: Hopf algebra\ndeformations exist only under some restrictions on the parameters. In\nparticular, affine Kac-Moody algebras are more rigid than their loop algebra\nquotients; and only the latter (in the case of sl(n)) can be deformed to\nelliptic Hopf algebras. The generalization to quasi-Hopf deformations lifts\nthis restriction. The full elliptic quantum groups (with central extension)\nassociated with $sl(n)$ are thus quasi-Hopf algebras. The universal R-matrices\nsatisfy a modified Yang-Baxter relation and are calculated more or less\nexplicitly. The modified classical Yang-Baxter relation is obtained, and the\nelliptic solutions are worked out explicitly. The same method is used to\nconstruct the Universal R-matrices associated with Felder's quantization of the\nKnizhnik-Zamolodchikov-Bernard equation, to throw some light on the quasi Hopf\nstructure of conformal field theory and (perhaps) the Calogero-Moser models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Nov 1996 20:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}
