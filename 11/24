This led to the surprising result that galaxy correlations are fractal\nand not homogeneous up to the limits of the available catalogues. In the\nmeantime many more redshifts have been measured and we have extended our\nmethods also to the analysis of number counts and angular catalogues. This has\nled to a complete analysis of all the available data that we are going to\npresent in detail in this lecture. In particular we will discuss the properties\nof the following catalogues: CfA, Perseus-Pisces, SSRS, IRAS, LEDA, Las\nCampanas and ESP for galaxies and Abell and ACO for clusters. The usual\nstatistical methods, that are based on the assumption of homogeneity, are\ntherefore inconsistent for all the length scales probed until now. A new, more\ngeneral, conceptual framework is necessary to identify the real physical\nproperties of these structures. In the range of self-similarity theories should\nshift from \"amplitudes\" to \"exponents\". The new analysis shows that all the\navailable data are consistent with each other and show fractal correlations\n(with dimension $D \\simeq 2$) up to the deepest scales probed until now ($1000\nh^{-1}Mpc$) and even more as indicated from the new interpretation of the\nnumber counts. The distribution of luminous matter in the universe is therefore\nfractal and not homogeneous. The evidence for this being very strong up to $150\nh^{-1}Mpc$ due to the statistical roboustness of the data and progressively\nweaker (statistically) at larger distances due to the limited data. These facts\nlead to fascinating conceptual implications about our knowledge of the universe\nand to a new scenario for the theoretical challenge in this field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Nov 1996 17:10:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Nov 1996 15:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
