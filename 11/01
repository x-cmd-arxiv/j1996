The sample thus provides an excellent\ndatabase for correlating direct mass estimates from lensing with indirect ones\nwhich rely on baryonic tracers. We examine the correlation between the cluster\nX-ray luminosities and the mean gravitational shear strengths and develop a\nmodel which predicts the relationship expected from the properties of local\nclusters. After allowing for various observational effects, we find that the\npredicted correlation is a reasonable match to the available data, indicating\nthat there has been little evolution in the X-ray luminosity-central mass\nrelationship between z=0.4 and now.

Such problems arise naturally in\nsignal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing,\nand handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to\nsegment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by\nthe segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent\nseveral similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple\ninstances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and\nconstraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP,\nreducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts\nof MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We\nthen demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically\nambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often\ngenerated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be\nused to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for\nMUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a\nMUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same\nvariable is shared by more than a single CSP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Nov 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
