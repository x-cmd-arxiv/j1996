Seeking for a natural solution to this second problem, it is noted\nthat SUSY GUTS, including SUSY SO(10) and E_6, can at best accommodate\nproton-stability by a suitable choice of the Higgs-multiplets and discrete\nsymmetries, but not really explain it, because they do not possess the desired\nsymmetries to suppress both d=4 and d=5 proton-decay operators.

We first\nshow that the nuclearly-derived subloop (normal associator subloop) $L^*$ of\n$L$ has exponent dividing 6. It follows that $L_p$ (the subloop of $L$ of\nelements of $p$-power order) is associative for $p>3$. Next, a loop $L$ is said\nto be a {\\it small Frattini Moufang loop}, or SFML, if $L$ has a central\nsubgroup $Z$ of order $p$ such that $C\\isom L/Z$ is an elementary abelian\n$p$-group. $C$ is thus given the structure of what we call a {\\it coded vector\nspace}, or CVS. (In the associative/group case, CVS's are either orthogonal\nspaces, for $p=2$, or symplectic spaces with attached linear forms, for $p>2$.)\nOur principal result is that every CVS may be obtained from an SFML in this\nway, and two SFML's are isomorphic in a manner preserving the central subgroup\n$Z$ if and only if their CVS's are isomorphic up to scalar multiple.\nConsequently, we obtain the fact that every SFM 2-loop is a code loop, in the\nsense of Griess, and we also obtain a relatively explicit characterization of\nisotopy in SFM 3-loops.
