It is\nshown that the collapse of the QRPA is physically meaningful and that it is\nassociated with the appearance of a state with zero energy in the spectrum. It\nis shown that in the RQRPA this particular feature is not present and that this\napproach leads to finite but otherwise spurious results for the double beta\ndecay transition amplitudes near the point of collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 1996 16:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Of the numerous suggestions put forward for the origin of this\nsupplementary interaction, none of those actually tested by calculations has\nbeen accepted as the solution of the problem. In this paper we seek a solution\nof the difficulty within the framework of a general formalism that starts from\nthe spherical shell model and is capable of treating an arbitrary linear\ncombination of multipole and pairing forces. With the restriction of the\ninteraction to the familiar sum of a quadrupole multipole force and a monopole\npairing force, we have previously studied a semi-microscopic version of the\nformalism whose framework is nevertheless more comprehensive than any\npreviously applied to the problem. We obtained solutions for low-lying bands of\nseveral strongly deformed odd rare earth nuclei and found good agreement with\nexperiment, except for an exaggerated staggering of levels for K=1/2 bands,\nwhich can be understood as a manifestation of the Coriolis attenuation problem.\nWe argue that within the formalism utilized, the only way to improve the\nphysics is to add interactions to the model Hamiltonian. We verify that by\nadding a magnetic dipole interaction of essentially fixed strength, we can fit\nthe K=1/2 bands without destroying the agreement with other bands. In addition\nwe show that our solution also fits 163Er, a classic test case of Coriolis\nattenuation that we had not previously studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 1996 19:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

Furthermore, after the r-process freezes out,\nthere appear to be distinctive neutral-current and charged-current\npostprocessing effects. A subtraction of the neutrino postprocessing effects\nfrom the observed solar r-process abundance distribution shows that two mass\nregions, A=124-126 and 183-187, are inordinately sensitive to neutrino\npostprocessing effects. This imposes very stringent bounds on the freeze-out\nradii and dynamic timescales governing the r-process. Moreover, we find that\nthe abundance patterns within these mass windows are entirely consistent with\nsynthesis by neutrino interactions. This provides a strong argument that the\nr-process must occur in the intense neutrino flux provided by a core-collapse\nsupernova.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 1996 20:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}

An in-depth study of the predicative ability of these sum rules is\ncarried out using a Monte-Carlo based uncertainty analysis. The results show\nthat the standard implementation of the QCD sum rule method has only marginal\npredicative power for the nucleon axial coupling constants, as the relative\nerrors are large. The errors range from approximately 50 to 100% compared to\nthe nucleon mass obtained from the same method, which has only 10% to 25%\nerror. The origin of the large errors is examined. Previous analyses of these\ncoupling constants are based on sum rules that have poor OPE convergence and\nlarge continuum contributions. Preferred sum rules are identified and their\npredictions are obtained. We also investigate the new sum rules with an\nalternative treatment of the problematic transitions which are not\nexponentially suppressed in the standard treatment.
