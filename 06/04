The radiation transfer calculations\nwere performed by assuming the flow is permeated by a magnetic field and fast\nparticle distribution in energy equipartition, with energy density proportional\nto the hydrodynamic energy density (i.e., pressure). We find that relativistic\nflows subject to strong perturbations exhibit a density structure consisting of\na series of nested bow shocks, and that this structure is evident in the\nintensity maps for large viewing angles. However, for viewing angles\n$<30^{\\circ}$, differential Doppler boosting leads to a series of axial knots\nof emission, similar to the pattern exhibited by many VLBI sources. The\nappearance of VLBI knots is determined primarily by the Doppler boosting of\nparts of a more extended flow. To study the evolution of a perturbed jet, a\ntime series of maps was produced and an integrated flux light curve created.\nThe light curve shows features characteristic of a radio loud AGN: small\namplitude variations and a large outburst. We find that in the absence of\nperturbations, jets with a modest Lorentz factor ($\\sim 5$) exhibit complex\nintensity maps, while faster jets (Lorentz factor $\\sim 10$) are largely\nfeatureless. We also study the appearance of kiloparsec jet-counterjet pairs by\nproducing simulated maps at relatively large viewing angles; we conclude that\nobserved hot spot emission is more likely to be associated with the Mach disk\nthan with the outer, bow shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 3 Jun 1996 19:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

This paper shows that this assumption is not necessarily\njustified and that the history of exposure accounting for ``local delays\" due\nto finite cloud equilibrium times can also be relevant. For this reason, a new\nformalism is developed in this paper for computing the observational properties\nof models which have local delays. The nature of the nonlinear behavior that\nresults is calculated for some very simple nonlinear cloud line emission\nmodels. It is found that the mean response time is a function of the recent\naverage value of the continuum. Linear models fit to these nonlinear systems\nrespond too slowly when there are low-energy (and generally rapid) changes in\nthe continuum, yet respond too rapidly when there are high-energy (and\ngenerally slow) changes in the continuum. As with systems without local delays,\nthe expression for the time-dependent line flux contains an integration over\nhistory of the ``spatial\" response function, which has structure at lags of the\nlight travel times of the emission region. However, the kernel of this integral\nitself is a function of additional integrations over individual ``cloud\"\nresponse functions which have structure at lags of the equilibrium times of the\ncloud properties relevant to line emission. If instantaneous or linear response\nis incorrectly assumed, local delays and nonlinear response can make a system\nappear larger than it actually is. These effects are similar to those that\nbeaming can cause. Local delays can also be a source of asymmetry about the\npeak of the cross-correlation function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 1996 01:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Bearing this in mind, as well as the smallness\nof the MSSM unification scale $M_X$ compared to the string scale, the\nconsequences of a previously suggested extension of the MSSM spectrum are\nexplored. The extension contains two vector--like families of quarks and\nleptons with relatively light masses of order 1 TeV, having the quantum numbers\nof ${\\bf 16}+{\\bf \\overline{16}}$ of $SO(10)$.

In addition to the well-known period-doubling instability\nwe show that under certain conditions the instability is caused by a Hopf\nbifurcation leading to quasiperiodic traveling waves. It occurs, for example,\nif the group velocities of both waves have different signs and the damping is\nweak. The dynamics above the threshold is briefly discussed. Examples\nconcerning ferromagnetic spin waves and surface waves of ferro fluids are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 1996 15:19:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
