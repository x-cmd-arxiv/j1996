Each of\nthese components has narrow Ly-alpha emission, and possibly NV emission and\nSiIV and CIV in absorption or with a P-Cygni profile. The second case is\nJ123652+621227, which has an arc-like feature offset by 1.8\" to the southwest\nof a red elliptical-like galaxy, and a ``counterimage'' offset 1.4\" on the\nopposite side.

The colors of the counterimage are consistent with the\nidentification of this line as Ly-alpha at z=3.36. The colors of the arc are\ndifferent than those of the counterimage, and thus both the colors and spectra\nindicate that this object is unlikely to be a gravitational lens. For a third\nlensing candidate (J123656+621221), which is a blue arc offset by 0.9\" from a\nred, elliptical-like galaxy, our spectroscopy does not clearly resolve the\nsystem spatially, complicating the interpretation of the spectrum.

The\nexistence of a universal R-matrix is demonstrated for the case when the\nparameters are in general position. Algebraic surfaces in parameter space are\ncharacterized by the appearance of certain ideals; in this case the universal\nR-matrix exists on the associated algebraic quotient. In special cases the\nquotient is a \"standard\" quantum group; all familiar quantum groups including\ntwisted ones are obtained in this way. In other special cases one finds new\ntypes of coboundary bi-algebras. The \"standard\" universal R-matrix is shown to\nbe the unique solution of a very simple, linear recursion relation. The\nclassical limit is obtained in the case of quantized Kac-Moody algebras of\nfinite and affine type. Returning to the general case, we study deformations of\nthe standard R-matrix and the associated Hopf algebras. A preliminary\ninvestigation of the first order deformations uncovers a class of deformations\nthat incompasses the quantization of all Kac-Moody algebras of finite and\naffine type. The corresponding exact deformations are described as generalized\ntwists, $ R_\\epsilon = (F^t)^{-1}RF$, where $R$ is the standard R-matrix and\nthe cocycle $F$ (a power series in the deformation parameter $\\epsilon$) is the\nsolution of a linear recursion relation of the same type as that which\ndetermines $R$. Included here is the universal R-matrix for the elliptic\nquantum groups associated with $sl(n)$, a big surprise! Specializing again, to\nthe case of quantized Kac-Moody algebras, and taking the classical limit of\nthese esoteric quantum groups, one re-discovers all the trigonometric and\nelliptic r-matrices of Belavin and Drinfeld. The formulas obtained here are\neasier to use than the original ones, and the structure of the space of\nclassical r-matrices is more transparent. The r-matrices obtained here are more\ngeneral in that they are defined on the full Kac-Moody algebras, the central\nextensions of the loop groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 1996 14:13:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-05-27"}
