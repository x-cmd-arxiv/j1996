Assuming that the dipole magnetic field of the protostar threads the\nprotostellar disk, we carried out 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)\nsimulations of the disk-star interaction. The closed magnetic loops connecting\nthe central star and the disk are twisted by the rotation of the disk. As the\ntwist accumulates, magnetic loops expand and finally approach to the open field\nconfiguration. A current sheet is formed inside the expanding loops. In the\npresence of resistivity, magnetic reconnection takes place in the current\nsheet. Outgoing magnetic island and post flare loops are formed as a result of\nthe reconnection. The time scale of this `flare' is the order of the rotation\nperiod of the disk. The released magnetic energy partly goes into the thermal\nenergy and heats up the flaring plasma up to $10^8$ K. The length of the\nflaring loop is several times of the radius of the central star, consistent\nwith observations. The speed of the hot plasmoid ejected by the reconnection is\n$200-400 $ km s$^{-1}$ when the footpoint of the loop is at 0.03 AU from 1\nM$_\\odot$ protostar. The hot plasma outflow can explain the speed and mass flow\nrate of optical jets. Dense, cold, magnetically accelerated wind ($v \\sim\n150-250$ km s$^{-1}$) emanates from the surface of the disk along the partially\nopen magnetic field lines threading the disk. This dense, cold wind may\ncorrespond to high velocity neutral winds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 1996 18:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Radio data from pointed\nobservations are now available for 359 of the 1055 LBQS quasars. The radio-loud\nfraction is constant at ~10% over the absolute magnitude range -28 <= MB <=\n-23, and it rises to ~20% (log R > 1) or ~35% (log L > 25) at the brightest\nabsolute magnitudes in the sample.

The reason for the high\nradio-loud fraction at bright absolute magnitudes in the PG, compared to the\nLBQS and other optically selected quasar surveys, is unknown. The trend of\nincreasing radio-loud fraction with absolute magnitude in the EMSS is due at\nleast in part to a correlation between X-ray and radio luminosity. Combining\nthe LBQS data with radio studies of high-redshift quasars leads to the\nconclusion that the radio-loud fraction in optically selected quasars does not\nappear to evolve significantly, aside from a modest increase at z ~1, from z =\n0.2 to redshifts approaching 5, a result that is contrary to previous studies\nwhich found a decrease in radio-loud fraction with increasing redshift by\ncomparing the low-z fraction in the PG to higher redshift samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 25 Jun 1996 22:48:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
