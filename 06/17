It appears that the\nenergy density rises faster than $T^4$ at high temperatures of $T\\approx\n200-300$~MeV. This indicates an increase in the number of degrees of freedom.\nMoreover, We have calculated direct photon production in Pb+Pb collisions at\n160~GeV/u within this model. The direct photon slope from the microscopic\ncalculation equals that from a hydrodynamical calculation without a phase\ntransition in the equation of state of the photon source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 1996 09:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It serves as a natural analogue of classical Lie bialgebra for the\ncase when the initial object is a quantized group. The explicit realization of\nthe deformed Lie-Poisson structure is a difficult problem. We study the special\nclass of such constructions characterized by quite a simple form of tanjent\nvector fields. It is proved that in such a case it is sufficient to find four\nLie compositions that form two deformations of the first order and four Lie\nbialgebras. This garantees the existence of two families of deformed\nLie-Poisson structures due to the intrinsic symmetry of the initial\ncompositions. The explicit example is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 17 Jun 1996 09:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
