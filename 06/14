If\ncomputations were carried out with exact arithmetic then it would be easy to\nensure such reversibility, but the use of approximate floating point arithmetic\ninevitably introduces violations of reversibility. In the absence of evidence\nto the contrary, we are usually prepared to accept that such rounding errors\ncan be made small enough to be innocuous, but in certain circumstances they are\nexponentially amplified and lead to blatantly erroneous results. We show that\nthere are two types of instability of the molecular dynamics trajectories which\nlead to this behavior, instabilities due to insufficiently accurate numerical\nintegration of Hamilton's equations, and intrinsic chaos in the underlying\ncontinuous fictitious time equations of motion themselves. We analyze the\nformer for free field theory, and show that it is essentially a finite volume\neffect. For the latter we propose a hypothesis as to how the Liapunov exponent\ndescribing the chaotic behavior of the fictitious time equations of motion for\nan asymptotically free quantum field theory behaves as the system is taken to\nits continuum limit, and explain why this means that instabilities in molecular\ndynamics trajectories are not a significant problem for Hybrid Monte Carlo\ncomputations.
