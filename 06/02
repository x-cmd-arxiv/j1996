We start with a power spectrum of density fluctuations that is\nexponentially damped outside a narrow range of scales and use numerical\nsimulations to study evolution of this power spectrum. Non-Linear effects\ngenerate power at other scales with most power flowing from larger to smaller\nscales. The ``cascade'' of power leads to equipartition of energy at smaller\nscales, implying a power spectrum with index $n\\approx -1$. We find that such a\nspectrum is produced in the range $1 < \\delta < 200$ for density contrast\n$\\delta$. This result continues to hold even when small scale power is added to\nthe initial power spectrum. Semi-analytic models for gravitational clustering\nsuggest a tendency for the effective index to move towards a critical index\n$n_c\\approx -1$ in this range. For n<n_c, power in this range grows faster than\nlinear rate, while if n>n_c, it grows at a slower rate - thereby changing the\nindex closer to n_c. At scales larger than the narrow range of scales with\ninitial power, a k^4 tail is produced. We demonstrate that non-linear small\nscales do not effect the growth of perturbations at larger scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 1996 10:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Dec 1996 11:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
