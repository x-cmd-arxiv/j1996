The results show that the the wind/environment\ninteraction produces strongly collimated supersonic jets. The jet is composed\nof shocked wind gas. Using analytical models of wind blown bubble evolution we\nshow that the scenario studied here should be applicable to YSOs and can, in\nprinciple, initiate collimation on the correct scales (R ~ 100 AU). The\nsimulations reveal a number of time-dependent non-linear features not\nanticipated in previous analytical studies including: a prolate wind shock; a\nchimney of cold swept-up ambient material dragged into the bubble cavity; a\nplug of dense material between the jet and bow shocks. We find that the\ncollimation of the jet occurs through both de Laval nozzles and focusing of the\nwind via the prolate wind shock.

Total rates\nof quarkonia produced in hadronic interactions as well as Feynman-x and\ntransverse momentum distributions can be described over the full range of\naccessible energies (15 < sqrt{s} < 1800 GeV) by two-stage processes. The\nquarkonium production cross section factors into a process-dependent\nshort-distance part and a single long-distance matrix element. The first part\ndescribing the production of a free quark--antiquark pair is the perturbatively\ncalculated subthreshold cross section. The non-perturbative factor turns out to\nbe universal, giving the model great predictive power. Furthermore we estimate\nthe fraction of the heavy-quark cross section leading to quarkonium for both\nthe charm and bottom systems. Finally, we comment on quarkonium\nphotoproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 1996 04:04:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
