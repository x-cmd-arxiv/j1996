We first motivate the particle content\nof the theory by examining the quantum numbers of the known standard model\nparticles and by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Once the particle\ncontent is fixed we can write down the most general renormalizable\nsuperpotential. However such a superpotential will contain terms breaking\nlepton and baryon number which leads us to the concept of R-parity\nconservation. The question of supersymmetry breaking is discussed next. We list\nthe possible soft breaking terms. However the Lagrangian involving the most\ngeneral soft breaking terms is phenomenologically intractable because of the\nappearance of the many new parameters. It also leads to some unacceptable\npredictions. To reduce the number of parameters we restrict ourself to the case\nwith universal soft breaking terms at the GUT scale. We motivate the need for\nuniversal soft breaking terms by the apparent unification of gauge couplings in\nthe MSSM and by the absence of flavor changing neutral currents. Then we\ndiscuss radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. Radiative breaking arises\nbecause the one loop corrections involving the large top Yukawa coupling change\nthe sign of the soft breaking mass parameter of the up-type Higgs doublet, this\nway introducing a nontrivial minimum in the Higgs potential. Finally we give an\noverview of the possible mixings in the MSSM and enumerate the physical (mass\neigenstate) fields together with the mass matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 22 Jun 1996 17:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-17"}
