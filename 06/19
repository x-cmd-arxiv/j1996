Of those two characteristics, field orientation is far more\nimportant in the cases we have considered with $\\beta_0 = p_g/p_b \\ge 1$. That\nis due to the geometry-sensitivity of field stretching/amplification from\nlarge-scale shearing motions around the bullet. When the ambient magnetic field\nis transverse to the bullet motion, even a very modest field, well below\nequipartition strength, can be amplified by field line stretching around the\nbullet within a couple of bullet crushing times so that Maxwell stresses become\ncomparable to the ram pressure associated with the bullet motion. The\npossibility is discussed that those situations might lead to large, induced\nelectric potentials capable of accelerating charged particles. When the ambient\nfield is aligned to the bullet motion, on the other hand, reconnection- prone\ntopologies develop that shorten the stretched field and release much of the\nexcess energy it contains. In this geometry, the Maxwell stresses on the bullet\nnever approach the ram pressure level. In both cases, however, the presence of\na field with even moderate initial strength acts to help the flow realign\nitself around the bullet into a smoother, more laminar form. That reduces\nbullet fragmentation tendencies caused by destructive instabilities. Eddies\nseem less effective at field amplification than flows around the bullet,\nbecause fields within eddies tend to be expelled to the eddy perimeters.\nSimilar effects cause the magnetic field within the bullet itself to be reduced\nbelow its initial value over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 1996 23:29:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

To do this, I consider imaginary\nsignals travelling over any inertial system K with arbitrarily large\nvelocities. The travelling of an imaginary signal over K is just a time lapse\nover K. Then I present an example to show that all coordinate systems are not\nequivalent when the related theory is restricted over tensor-based coordinate\ntransformations, i.e., the genereal relativity principle is not valid. Instead\nof the relativity principle, I propose the twofold metric principle which may\nbe roughly stated to assert that the set of equations H(v) describing the\nmotion of a material body with velocity v> 0 can be obtained from the\ncorresponding set of equations H(0) for velocity v=0 by replacing, in each\ndifferential equation in H(0), each infinitesimal time variable dt with dt /\n\\beta(v) , each maximal velocity-critical infinitesimal length variable dr with\nbeta(v) dr, and each zero velocity-critical infinitesimal length variable dx\nwith dx, where beta(v) = 1/ sqrt {1- v^2/c^2}. By depending on the twofold\nmetric principle and the energy-velocity equation, I derive beta(v)mc^2, the\ntwofold Schwarzshild metric, the centennial procession of planatery orbits and\ndeflection of light. We also present a reason why the Michelson-Morley\nexperiment is observed. Several other topics are also studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 1996 05:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

When the states correspond to a spinor spot of the Dynkin\ndiagram they are kinks which carry a non-zero topological charge. Using these\nresults, the S-matrices of the supersymmetric O($2n$) sigma model and\nsine-Gordon model can be shown to close under the bootstrap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 19 Jun 1996 09:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

By\nadding an array of 84 Si-CsI(Tl) telescopes the solid-angle coverage of the\nsetup was extended to \\theta_lab = 16 degree. This permitted the complete\ndetection of fragments from the projectile-spectator source.\n  The dominant feature of the systematic set of data is the Z_bound\nuniversality that is obeyed by the fragment multiplicities and correlations.\nThese observables are invariant with respect to the entrance channel if plotted\nas a function of Z_bound, where Z_bound is the sum of the atomic numbers Z_i of\nall projectile fragments with Z_i \\geq 2. No significant dependence on the\nbombarding energy nor on the target mass is observed. The dependence of the\nfragment multiplicity on the projectile mass follows a linear scaling law.\n  The reasons for and the limits of the observed universality of spectator\nfragmentation are explored within the realm of the available data and with\nmodel studies. It is found that the universal properties should persist up to\nmuch higher bombarding energies than explored in this work and that they are\nconsistent with universal features exhibited by the intranuclear cascade and\nstatistical multifragmentation models.\n  PACS numbers: 25.70.Mn, 25.70.Pq, 25.75.-q\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 18 Jun 1996 19:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
