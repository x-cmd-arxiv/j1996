The infrared images were obtained in 0.5\" seeing, and show that\nthe object (denoted HR10) is not a dynamically relaxed elliptical galaxy\ndominated by an old stellar population as was previously suspected, but instead\nhas an asymmetric morphology suggestive of either a disk or an interacting\nsystem. The infrared spectrum of HR10 shows a single, possibly broad emission\nfeature at 1.60um which we identify as Halpha+[NII] at z=1.44. The luminosity\nand width of this emission line indicates either intense star formation (about\n20h^{-2} solar masses/yr) or the presence of an active nucleus. Based on the\nrest frame UV-optical spectral energy distribution, the luminosity of HR10 is\nestimated to be 3 to 8 L*. The colors of HR10 are unusually red for a galaxy\n(at z=1.44 the age of HR10 is at most 2 to 8 Gyr depending on cosmology), and\nindicate that HR10 is dusty. HR10 is detected weakly at radio wavelengths; this\nis consistent with either the starburst or AGN hypothesis. If HR10 is a typical\nrepresentative of its class, EROs are numerous and represent a significant\ncomponent of the luminous objects in the Universe at z approx 1.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 2 Jun 1996 20:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Most\nemission lines are spectrally resolved, yet all have dispersions sigma<100km/s.\nFive of the 24 sample members have OII doublet line flux ratios which imply gas\ndensities in excess of 100 cm^-3.

The remaining 19 linewidths are too large by a factor of\ntwo (7sigma significance) to be attributed to turbulent motions within an\nindividual star forming region, and therefore most likely reflect the orbital\nmotion of ionized gas in the galaxy. We use Fabry--Perot observations of nearby\ngalaxies to construct simulated datasets that mimic our observational setup at\nz=0.25; these allow us to compute the expected distribution of (observable)\nlinewidths sigma_v for a galaxy of a given ``true'' (optical) rotation speed\nv_c.
