The quasar was detected at both frequencies\n(\\approx 0.7 mJy) with a flat spectrum. All four lensed images are clearly\nresolved at 3.6 cm, and the agreement of the radio and optical image positions\nis excellent. No radio emission is detected from the lensing galaxy, and any\nfifth lensed quasar image must be fainter than \\sim 20% of the A image flux\ndensity. Since the optical quasar images are variable and susceptible to\nextinction, radio flux ratios provide the best measurement of the macrolensing\nmagnification ratios. The radio B/A and C/A image flux ratios are consistent\nwith the observed range of optical variations, but the D/A ratio is\nconsistently higher in the radio than in the optical. The radio ratios are\nconsistent with magnification ratios predicted by lens models, and weaken\nalternative interpretations for Q2237+0305. More accurate radio ratios can\ndistinguish between the models, as well as improve our understanding of both\nmicrolensing and extinction in this system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 1996 22:25:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

It is this additional threshold that imposes the ultimate limit on the\ncompactification scale: Any compactification must have M_{Kaluza Klein} >\n4*10^7 Gev; for most compactifications, the actual limit is much higher.\n(Generically, M_{Kaluza Klein} > alpha_{GUT} M_{Planck} in either SO(32) or\nE_8*E_8 heterotic string.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 1996 19:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
