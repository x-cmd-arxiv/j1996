According to the simulations\nof the interaction-based dynamical systems model, the following scenario of the\ncell differentiation is proposed. (1) Up to some threshold number, divisions\nbring about almost identical cells with synchronized biochemical oscillations.\n(2)As the number is increased the oscillations lose the synchrony, leading to\ngroups of cells with different phases of oscillations. (3)Amplitudes of\noscillation and averaged chemical compositions start to differ by groups of\ncells. The differentiated behavior of states is transmitted to daughter cells.\n(4)Recursivity is formed so that the daughter cells keep the identical chemical\ncharacter. This ``memory\" is made possible through the transfer of initial\nconditions. (5) Successive differentiation proceeds. Mechanism of tumor cell\nformation, origin of stem cells, anomalous differentiation by transplantations,\napoptosis and other features of cell differentiation process are also\ndiscussed, with some novel predictions.

Seven of these systems have measured mass\nfunctions or mass estimates in excess of stable neutron stars, making them\nexcellent black hole candidates.

This will allow us\nto search for black holes of more moderate mass and apply the knowledge of\nthese systems to suspected supermassive black holes in AGN's. The most\nplausible mechanism for triggering the outburst of black hole candidate X-ray\ntransients is the ionization thermal instability. The disk instability models\ncan give the deduced mass flow in quiescence, but not the X-ray spectrum.\nAdvection models that can account for the quiescent X-ray spectrum are\ndifficult to match with the non-steady state, quiescent Keplerian disks.\nSelf-irradiation of the disk in outburst may not lead to X-ray reprocessing as\nthe dominant source of optical light, but may play a role in the ``reflare.\"\nThe hard power-law spectrum and radio bursts may be non-thermal processes\ndriven by the flow of pair--rich plasma from the disk at early times and due to\nthe formation of a pair--rich plasma corona at late times. The repeated\noutbursts in systems like GRO J0422+32 suggest some sort of clock, but it is\nunlikely that it has anything to do with a simple X-ray heating of the\ncompanion star.
