We first show that the model assumptions of ELT can be relaxed\nmaterially: an exact relation between the velocity and line density is derived\nfor any cylinder (not necessarily axisymmetric), with an arbitrary constituent\ndistribution function (so isothermality need not be assumed). We then consider\nthe same problem in the context of the modified dynamics (MOND). After a brief\ncomparison between scaling properties in the two theories, we study idealized\nMOND model filaments. A preliminary application to the segment of the\nPerseus-Pisces filament treated by ELT, gives MOND M/L estimates of order 10\ns.u., compared with the Newtonian value of about 450, which ELT find. In spite\nof the large uncertainties still besetting the analysis, this instance of MOND\napplication is of particular interest because: 1. Objects of this geometry have\nnot been dealt with before. 2. It pertains to large-scale structure. 3. The\ntypical accelerations involved are the lowest so far encountered in a\nsemi-virialized system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 24 Jun 1996 14:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
