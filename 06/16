This signal should be readily detectable by the next generation of\nanisotropy mapping experiments. The signature arises from overdensities in the\nphoton-baryon fluid generated by the gravitational attraction of the defects.\nThe angular power spectrum of the anisotropy fluctuations on subdegree scales\nis also calculated, for cosmic string, global monopoles, and texture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 16 Jun 1996 14:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The crucial point is that the\n(super)gravity-mediated curvature of all the scalar fields (and, in particular,\nof the inflaton), which in the standard F-dominated case is of the order of the\nHubble parameter, is absent in the D-term inflation case.
