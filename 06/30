The experimental results look to\nbe in contradiction with each other, even disregarding some experiment: unless\nelectron neutrinos disappear in their trip from the sun to the earth, the\nfluxes of intermediate energy neutrinos (those from 7Be electron capture and\nfrom the CNO cycle) result to be unphysically negative, or anyway extremely\nreduced with respect to standard solar model predictions. Next we review\nextensively non-standard solar models built as attempts to solve the solar\nneutrino puzzle. The dependence of the central solar temperature on chemical\ncomposition, opacity, age and on the values of the astrophysical S-factors for\nhydrogen-burning reactions is carefully investigated. Also, possible\nmodifications of the branching among the various pp-chains in view of nuclear\nphysics uncertainties are examined. Assuming standard neutrinos, all solar\nmodels examined fail in reconciling theory with experiments, even when the\nphysical and chemical inputs are radically changed with respect to present\nknowledge and even if some of the experimental results are discarded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 30 Jun 1996 09:38:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 1996 07:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-01-04"}
