We find that the intersite density fluctuations suppress\nthe charge Kondo energy scale and lead to a Fermi liquid to non-Fermi liquid\ntransition for repulsive on-site density-density interactions. In the absence\nof intersite interactions, this transition reduces to the known\nKosterlitz-Thouless transition. We show that a new line of non-Fermi liquid\nfixed points replace those of the zero intersite interaction problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 13 Jun 1996 05:58:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
