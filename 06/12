This rule arose from well-established methods in the theory of plastic\ndeformations, where crystals with defects are described mathematically by\napplying nonholonomic coordinate transformations to ideal crystals. In the\ncontext of time-sliced path integrals, this has given rise to a {\\em quantum\nequivalence principle\\/} which determines the measure of fluctating orbits in\nspaces with curvature and torsion. The nonholonomic transformations are\naccompanied by a nontrivial Jacobian which in curved spaces produces an\nadditional energy proportional to the curvature scalar, thereby canceling an\nequal term found earlier by DeWitt from a naive formulation of Feynman's\ntime-sliced path integral in curved space. The importance of this cancelation\nhas been documented in various systems (H-atom, particle on the surface of a\nsphere, spinning top). Here we point out its relevance in the process of\nbosonizing a nonabelian one-dimensional quantum field theory, whose fields live\nin a flat field space.

The coupling constants and the mass of the\n$\\sigma$-meson are determined from the properties of symmetric nuclear matter\nand the rms charge radius in $^{40}$Ca. Calculated properties of static,\nclosed-shell nuclei from $^{16}$O to $^{208}$Pb are compared with experimental\ndata and with results of Quantum Hadrodynamics (QHD). The dependence of the\nresults on the nucleon size and the quark mass is investigated. Several\npossible extensions of the model are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 12 Jun 1996 06:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-02-17"}
