Our main concern is\nto characterize those systems that, under the renormalization flow, are driven\naway from the Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) renormalization group fixed point. We\nare especially interested in understanding under what circumstances such a\nsystem is a Marginal Fermi liquid (MFL) when the dimension of space is greater\nor equal than 2 . The interacting electron system is analyzed by combining\nrenormalization group (RG) methods with bosonization techniques. The RG\ncalculations are organized as a double expansion in the inverse scale\nparameter, $\\lambda^{-1} ,$ which is proportional to the width of the effective\nmomentum space around the Fermi surface and in the running coupling constant, $\ng_\\lambda , $ which measures the strength of electron interactions at\ncorresponding energy scales. Excluding a superconducting instability, the\nsystem can be analyzed by means of bosonization. The RG and the underlying\nperturbation expansion in powers of $ \\lambda^{-1} $ serve to characterize the\napproximations involved by bosonizing the system. We argue that systems with\nshort-range interactions flow to the LFL fixed point. Within the approximations\ninvolved by bosonization, the same holds for systems with long-range,\nlongitudinal, density-density interactions. For electron systems interacting\nvia long-range, transverse, current-current interactions a deviation from LFL\nbehaviour is possible : the results of the bosonization calculation are\nconsistent with a MFL, if the exponent parametrizing the singularity of the\ninteraction potential in momentum space is greater than or equal to d-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 1996 17:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Evaluation of the thermal properties\nof each of the black holes in a neutral pair leads one to check that to an\nasymptotic abserver in either universe, each black hole is exactly the\nquantum-mechanically defined {\\it anti-black hole} to the other hole in the\npair. The independent quantum states of black holes in neutral pairs have been\nformulated by using the path integral method, and shown to be that of a\nharmonic oscillator. Our results suggest that the boundary condition of a\nsingle universe in the metauniverse is that this universe can never be\nself-contained and must always have at least one boundary which connects it to\nthe rest of a self-contained metauniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 1996 16:15:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

This\nnotion generalizes the notion of disjoint (or direct) sums of models by letting\nthe summands overlap. In the first section we investigate types in distorted\nsums and show that the type of a sequence of elements A is determined by the\n`local' type of A (i.e. the type restricted to a neighborhood of A). We\nsimplify the proofs in [Sh:463] and improve the bounds on the radii needed to\ndetermine the types.\n  Natural examples of distorted sums are models with distant functions. In the\nsecond and third sections we discuss such models and improve a theorem by\nGaifman, that states that each formula is equivalent to a boolean combination\nof local formulas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 15 Jun 1996 00:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2019 12:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-09-02"}
