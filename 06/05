First, the spectral\nenergy distribution in the mid-ultraviolet range 2000 < lam < 2400 exceeds\nobservation by ~ 0.6 mag. Most of that excess is due to metal-poor main\nsequence stars. Second, the models do not reproduce metal-sensitive optical\nabsorption features that arise mainly from red giant stars. Third, the strength\nof a Ca II index sensitive to hot stars does not jibe with the predicted number\nof A-type horizontal branch stars. The number of metal poor stars in galaxies\nis at least a factor of two less than predicted by the Simple model, exactly\nsimilar to the ``G Dwarf problem'' in the solar cylinder. Observations at\nlarger radii in local group galaxies indicate that the paucity of metal poor\nstars applies globally, rather than only in the nuclei. Because of the\ndominance of metal rich stars, primordial galaxies will have a plentiful dust\nsupply early in their star formation history, and thus will probably have weak\nLyman-alpha emission, as is apparently observed. We confirm that early-type\ngalaxies cannot have been formed exclusively from mergers of small all-stellar\nsubsystems, a result already established by dynamical simulations. The\nconstraint of peaked abundance distributions will limit future chemical\nevolution models. It will also make age estimates for the stellar populations\nin early type galaxies and bulges more secure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 4 Jun 1996 16:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Collapse dynamics has been dealt with in\npaper I of this series by means of the powerful Lagrangian perturbation theory\nand the simple ellipsoidal collapse model. The basic quantity considered here\nis the inverse collapse time F; it is a non-linear functional of the initial\npotential, with a non-Gaussian distribution. In the case of sharp k-space\nsmoothing, it is demonstrated that the fraction of collapsed mass can be\ndetermined by extending to the F process the diffusion formalism introduced by\nBond et al.

For Gaussian smoothing, the F\ntrajectories are strongly correlated in resolution. In this case, an\napproximation proposed by Peacock & Heavens (1990) can be used to determine the\nmass functions.
