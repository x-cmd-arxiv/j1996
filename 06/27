Among the interesting\nfeatures of those models was the presence of D5-branes behaving like small\ninstantons, and the appearance of extra tensor multiplets. These are both\nnon-perturbative phenomena from the point of view of heterotic string theory.\nAlthough the orientifold models are a natural setting in which to study these\nnon-perturbative Heterotic string phenomena, it is interesting and instructive\nto explore how such vacua are realised in Heterotic string theory, M-theory and\nF-theory, and consider the relations between them. In particular, we consider\nmodels of M-theory compactified on K3 x S^1/Z_2 with fivebranes present on the\ninterval. There is a family of such models which yields the same spectra as a\nsubfamily of the orientifold models. By further compactifying on T^2 to four\ndimensions we relate them to Heterotic string spectra. We then use\nHeterotic/Type IIA duality to deduce the existence of Calabi-Yau 3-folds which\nshould yield the original six dimensional orientifold spectra if we use them to\ncompactify F-theory. Finally, we show in detail how to take a limit of such an\nF-theory compactification which returns us to the Type IIB orientifold models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 1996 03:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
