The spectrum features global\nH charges, vortices carrying flux labeled by the elements of H and dyonic\ncombinations. Due to the Aharonov-Bohm effect these particles exhibit\ntoplogical interactions. The remnant of the U(1)^k CS term in the discrete H\ngauge theory describing the effective long distance physics of such a model is\nshown to be a 3-cocycle for H summarizing the nontrivial topological\ninteractions cast upon the magnetic vortices by the U(1)^k CS term. It is noted\nthat there are in general three types of 3-cocycles for a finite abelian gauge\ngroup H: one type describes topological interactions among vortices carrying\nflux w.r.t. the same cyclic group in the direct product H, another type gives\nrise to topological interactions between vortices carrying flux w.r.t. two\ndifferent cyclic factors of H and a third type leading to topological\ninteractions between vortices carrying flux w.r.t. three different cyclic\nfactors. Among other things, it is demonstrated that only the first two types\ncan be obtained from a spontaneously broken U(1)^k CS theory. The 3-cocycles\nthat can not be reached in this way turn out to be the most interesting. They\nrender the theory nonabelian and in general lead to dualities with planar\ntheories with a nonabelian finite gauge group. In particular, the CS theory\nwith finite gauge group H = Z_2 x Z_2 x Z_2 defined by such a 3-cocycle is\nshown to be dual to the planar discrete D_4 gauge theory with D_4 the dihedral\ngroup of order 8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 6 Jun 1996 17:33:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
