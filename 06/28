In this paper, we perform such a\nstudy for the case of SO(10) free-field string GUT models, and find a number of\nsignificant new results. First, we show that within the conventional string\nmodels using the so-called ``diagonal'' embeddings, all representations larger\nthan the 16 must always transform as singlets under all gauge symmetries beyond\nSO(10). This includes the 45 and 54 representations, and holds regardless of\nthe affine level at which SO(10) is realized. Furthermore, we show that such\nconstructions can never give rise to the 120, 126, or 144 representations of\nSO(10) --- again regardless of the affine level. We also perform a similar\nanalysis for E_6, and find that the adjoint 78 representation must always\ntransform as a singlet under all gauge symmetries beyond E_6; moreover, all\nrepresentations beyond the 78 representation are prohibited. Taken together,\nthese results thus severely limit the types of phenomenologically realistic\nfield-theoretic SO(10) and E_6 models that can be obtained using such string\nconstructions. Finally, we also explore the possibility of using non-diagonal\nfree-field embeddings, and show that in the SO(10) case such embeddings may\nhave improved phenomenological prospects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 1996 05:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Mar 1997 19:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We show that the stress intensity\nfactor required to propagate the crack is increased as the crack is blunted by\nup to thirteen atomic layers, but only by a relatively modest amount for a\ncrack with a sharp 60$^\\circ$ corner. The effect of the blunting is far less\nthan would be expected from a smoothly blunted crack; the sharp corners\npreserve the stress concentration, reducing the effect of the blunting.\nHowever, for some material parameters blunting changes the preferred\ndeformation mode from brittle cleavage to dislocation emission. In such\nmaterials, the absorption of preexisting dislocations by the crack tip can\ncause the crack tip to be locally arrested, causing a significant increase in\nthe microscopic toughness of the crack tip. Continuum plasticity models have\nshown that even a moderate increase in the microscopic toughness can lead to an\nincrease in the macroscopic fracture toughness of the material by several\norders of magnitude. We thus propose an atomic-scale mechanism at the crack\ntip, that ultimately may lead to a high fracture toughness in some materials\nwhere a sharp crack would seem to be able to propagate in a brittle manner.\nResults for blunt cracks loaded in mode II are also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 27 Jun 1996 20:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 1996 16:11:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 1996 15:33:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

From the interplay\nbetween these constraints and the spectral function basic features of the\nexclusive and inclusive nuclear responses are seen to arise. In particular, the\nresponses of the relativistic Fermi gas and of a specific hybrid model with\nconfined nucleons in the initial state are compared in this work. As expected,\nthe exclusive responses are significantly different in the two models, whereas\nthe inclusive ones are rather similar. By extending previous work on the\nrelativistic Fermi gas, a reduced response is introduced for the hybrid model\nsuch that it fulfills the Coulomb and the higher-power energy-weighted sum\nrules. While incorporating specific classes of off-shellness for the struck\nnucleons, it is found that the reducing factor required is largely\nmodel-independent and, as such, yields a reduced response that is useful for\nextracting the Coulomb sum rule from experimental data. Finally, guided by the\ndifference between the energy-weighted sum rules of the two models, a version\nof the relativistic Fermi gas is devised which has the 0$^{\\rm th}$, 1$^{\\rm\nst}$ and 2$^{\\rm nd}$ moments of the charge response which agree rather well\nwith those of the hybrid model: this version thus incorporates {\\em a priori}\nthe binding and confinement effects of the stuck nucleons while retaining the\nsimplicity of the original Fermi gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 28 Jun 1996 14:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
