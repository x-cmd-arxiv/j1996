For configurations whose\ntotal magnetic charge is purely abelian, the moduli space for nonabelian\nbreaking can be obtained as a smooth limit of that for a purely abelian\nbreaking. As the asymptotic Higgs field is varied toward one of the special\nvalues for which the unbroken symmetry is enlarged to a nonabelian group, some\nof the fundamental monopoles of unit topological charge remain massive but\nacquire nonabelian magnetic charges. The BPS mass formula indicates that others\nshould become massless in this limit. We find that these do not correspond to\ndistinct solitons but instead manifest themselves as ``nonabelian clouds''\nsurrounding the massive monopoles. The moduli space coordinates describing the\nposition and $U(1)$ phase of these massless monopoles are transformed into an\nequal number of nonabelian global gauge orientation and gauge-invariant\nstructure parameters characterizing the nonabelian cloud. We illustrate this\nexplicitly in a class of $Sp(2N)$ examples for which the full family of\nmonopole solutions is known. We show in detail how the unbroken symmetries of\nthe theory are manifested as isometries of the moduli space metric. We discuss\nthe connection of these results to the Montonen-Olive duality conjecture,\narguing in particular that the massless monopoles should be understood as the\nduals to the massless gauge bosons that appear as the mediators of the\nnonabelian forces in the perturbative sector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 May 1996 17:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

This generates effective interactions in the\nrenormalized Hamiltonian, $H_{_{R}}$. These effective interactions are derived\nto order $\\alpha$ in this work, with $\\alpha \\ll 1$. $H_{_{R}}$ is renormalized\nby requiring it to satisfy coupling coherence. A nonrelativistic limit of the\ntheory is taken, and the resulting Hamiltonian is studied using bound-state\nperturbation theory (BSPT).
