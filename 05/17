To\nachieve polarized proton beams in RHIC (250GeV), HERA (820GeV), and the\nTEVATRON (900GeV), ideas and techniques new to accelerator physics are needed.\nIn this publication we will stress an important aspect of very high energy\npolarized proton beams, namely the fact that the equilibrium polarization\ndirection can vary substantially across the beam in the interaction region of a\nhigh energy experiment when no countermeasure is taken. Such a divergence of\nthe polarization direction would not only diminish the average polarization\navailable to the particle physics experiment, but it would also make the\npolarization involved in each collision analyzed in a detector strongly\ndependent on the phase space position of the interacting particle. In order to\nanalyze and compensate this effect, methods for computing the equilibrium\npolarization direction are needed. In this paper we introduce the method of\nstroboscopic averaging, which computes this direction in a very efficient way.\nSince only tracking data is needed, our method can be implemented easily in\nexisting spin tracking programs. Several examples demonstrate the importance of\nthe spin divergence and the applicability of stroboscopic averaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 1996 09:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-12-18"}
