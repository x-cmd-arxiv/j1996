A positive vacuum\ndensity leads to correlation-function contours which are squashed in the radial\ndirection when calculated assuming a matter-dominated model. We show that this\neffect will be somewhat harder to detect than previous calculations have\nsuggested: the squashing factor is likely to be $<1.3$, given realistic\nconstraints on the matter contribution to $\\Omega$. Moreover, the geometrical\ndistortion risks being confused with the redshift-space distortions caused by\nthe peculiar velocities associated with the growth of galaxy clustering. These\ndepend on the density and bias parameters via the combination $\\beta\\equiv\n\\Omega^{0.6}/b$, and we show that the main practical effect of a geometrical\nflattening factor $F$ is to simulate gravitational instability with $\\beta_{\\rm\neff}\\simeq 0.5(F-1)$. Nevertheless, with datasets of sufficient size it is\npossible to distinguish the two effects; we discuss in detail how this should\nbe done. New-generation redshift surveys of galaxies and quasars are\npotentially capable of detecting a non-zero vacuum density, if it exists at a\ncosmologically interesting level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 May 1996 16:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The results are applied\nto giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and to individual dense cores, with an eye to\naccounting for recent observations of the internal velocity-dispersion profiles\nof the cores in particular. We argue that GMCs and massive cores are at or near\ntheir critical mass, and that in such a case the size-linewidth and mass-radius\nrelations between them are only weakly dependent on their internal structures;\nany gas equation of state leads to essentially the same relations. We briefly\nconsider the possibility that molecular clouds can be described by polytropic\npressure-density relations (of either positive or negative index), but show\nthat these are inconsistent with the apparent gravitational virial equilibrium,\n2U + W = 0 of GMCs and of massive cores.
