An adiabatic\nargument suggests that in the large $N$ limit an effective extra uncompactified\ndimension might be observed.

As the first candidate take the LSZ-asymptotic states in a\ncovariant canonical formalism to investigate gauge independence of the\n(Belinfante's) symmetric energy-momentum tensor. It is shown that expectation\nvalues of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of those asymptotic states are\ngauge independent to all orders. Second, consider gauge invariant operators of\nelectron or photon, such as the Dirac's electron or Steinmann's covariant\napproach, expecting a gauge invariant result without any restriction. It is,\nhowever, demonstrated that to single out gauge invariant quantities is merely\nsynonymous to a gauge fixing, resulting again in use of the asymptotic\ncondition when proving gauge independence. Nevertheless, it is commented that\nthese invariant approaches is helpful to understand the mechanism of the\nLSZ-mapping and furthermore of quark confinement in QCD. As the final\ncandidate, it is shown that gauge transformations are freely performed under\nthe functional representation or the path integral expression on account of the\nfact that the functional space is equivalent to a collection of infinitely many\ninequivalent Fock spaces.
