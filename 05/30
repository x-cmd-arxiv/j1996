The star formation happens inside the clouds of cold gas, which are\nproduced via thermal instability. We simulate the galaxy formation in standard\nbiased CDM model for a variety of parameters and for several resolutions in the\nrange 2--20$h^{-1}$kpc. In our picture, supernova feedback regulates the\nevolution of the gas components and star formation. The efficiency of cloud\nevaporation by supernova strongly influences star formation rates. This\nfeedback results in a steady rate of star formation in large galaxies (mass\nlarger than $2-3x10^{11}\\Msun$) at a level of $(1-10)\\Msun\\yr$ for $z<3$.\nSupernova feedback has an even stronger effect on the evolution of dwarf\ngalaxies, most of which have a small fraction of stars and extremely low\nluminosities: $M_R>-15$.
