Data for interacting\ngalaxies, many of which are undergoing a starburst, and for normal galaxies\nhave been analysed and compared in order to test for any influence of the\nstar-formation activity on the ratio between the FIR and the radio emission at\n2.4 GHz, $\\q24$. No statistically significant indication for such an influence\nhas been found: There is neither a significant difference between $\\q24$ of the\ntwo samples nor a dependence of this ratio on the starburst strength. This\nobservational fact is unexpected because of the different physical conditions\nand the short time-scale of the star-formation activity in a starburst. In\norder to interprete the observations the FIR and the radio emission during a\nstarburst have been modeled. The following conclusions could be drawn from the\nobserved constancy of $\\q24$: A strong and fast ($\\approx 10^7$ yr) increase of\nthe magnetic field at the beginning of the starburst is required in order to\nmaintain a constant $\\q24$. Otherwise the strong Inverse Compton losses that\nare due to the intense radiation field in a starburst would lower the\nsynchrotron emission drastically resulting in a value of $\\q24$ significantly\nhigher than the observed one. Furthermore, the time-scale of the variation of\nthe star-formation rate has to be longer than some $10^7$ yr. For lower values\nthe different time-scales of the FIR and the radio emission produce large\nfluctuations of $\\q24$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 1996 13:19:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The widths\nobtained differ significantly from the formal R--matrix values but they are\nclose to those measured as full widths at half maxima of the spectra in various\nexperiments. The energies are somewhat lower than those given by usual\nestimates of the peak positions. The extracted values are close to the\nS--matrix poles calculated previously from the multi--term analyses of the\nN-$^4$He elastic scattering data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 May 1996 05:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
