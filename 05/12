We analyze\na specific attack of this type, for which we find the density matrices\navailable to the eavesdropper and the optimal information which can be\nextracted from them. We prove security against this attack and discuss security\nagainst any attack allowed by the rules of quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 May 1996 20:28:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 1997 15:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
