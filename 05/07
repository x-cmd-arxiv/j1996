This\nflow equation describes the scale dependence of the effective average action\nwhich has a built-in infrared cutoff. For c<1 it is solved approximately by a\ntruncation of the space of action functionals. We derive the Ward identities\nassociated to Weyl transformations in presence of the infrared cutoff. They are\nused to select a specific universality class for the renormalization group\ntrajectory which is found to connect two conformal field theories with central\ncharges 25-c and 26-c, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 May 1996 09:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
