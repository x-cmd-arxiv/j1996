In addition, they predict that systems with large star formation rates\nare unlikely to be much more abundant in the past than they are at present.\nRecent data show that the star formation rate in the nearby universe is, in\nfact, a substantial fraction of that required to make all the stars seen in\ngalaxies, and that the observed abundance of objects forming stars at rates in\nexcess of 10 solar masses per yr is approximately the same at redshifts of 1.25\nand 3.25 as it is at z = 0.
