The cross section for\ndiffractive deep-inelastic scattering is measured in terms of a diffractive\nstructure function $F_2^{D(3)}(\\beta,Q^2,\\xpom)$ over an extended kinematic\nrange. The dependence of $F_2^{D(3)}$ on $\\xpom$ is found not to depend on\n$Q^2$, but to depend on $\\beta$. Therefore the $\\xpom$ dependence no longer\nfactorizes. The $Q^2$ and $\\beta$ dependence of $F_2^{D(3)}$ is analyzed after\nan integration over the dependence on $\\xpom$.
