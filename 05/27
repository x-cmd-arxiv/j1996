We\nfind that a large fraction of these sources are variable, flat-spectrum\nquasars. This brings the total fraction of flat-spectrum quasars with a ratio\nbetween radio and optical flux of R>10 - a value previously used to define a\nradio-loud quasar - to 40% in the PG quasar sample. We also find that the\nmedian R-parameter of these flat-spectrum quasars is lower than those of\nsteep-spectrum radio-loud quasars. This contradicts the predictions of the\nunified scheme and the idea that all flat-spectrum, core-dominated quasars are\nrelativistically boosted lobe-dominated quasars. We show that this discrepancy\nis due to a population of flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars with\n25<R<250 which can neither be explained as relativistically boosted radio-loud\nquasars nor as normal radio-weak quasars. We point out that a natural\nexplanation for the flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars is relativistic\nboosting in radio-weak quasars. If the flat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars\nare considered the boosted counterparts to usual radio-weak quasars, their\nfraction among radio-weak quasars is roughly 10%, similar to the fraction of\nboosted radio-loud quasars. This would point towards average Lorentz factors of\ngamma_jet=2-4 for radio-loud and radio-weak quasars. The presence of the\nflat-spectrum radio-intermediate quasars changes the definition of 'radio-loud'\nand can bias some conclusions drawn from optically selected quasar samples,\nwhere R ~ 1-10 is used as the dividing line for both, flat- and steep-spectrum\nquasars. Instead one should use separate R-parameters for the dividing line in\nsteep- (R~25) and flat-spectrum (R~250) quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 May 1996 15:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
