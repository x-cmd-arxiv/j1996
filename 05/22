Understanding the way in which dust interacts with the radiation and\ninfluences the physical conditions of the gas is crucial if we want to learn\nabout the nature of the central active nucleus and about the physical\nconditions of the ISM in such galaxies. Not taking into account such effects\nmay lead us towards misleading interpretations. Many intriguing questions\nconcerns to the nature and the existence of dust in active galaxies: for\ninstance, under which conditions does the very hard ionizing continuum of an\nAGN allows the survival of dust grains? Is the composition and size\ndistribution of the dust the same as in our local interstellar medium? How is\ndust distributed compared to the gas which is at least in part highly ionized\nby the central AGN? Does dust also exist in radio galaxies at very high\nredshifts? The work developed in this thesis tries to find answers to some of\nthese questions, through a detailed theoretical and observational research of\nthe mechanisms which control the interaction of dust with the radiation and\nwith the ions. The observable effects of the dust on the emission line spectrum\nare also analyzed in detail. The final goal has been to give clues about more\ngeneral questions: origin of the emitting gas, ionization mechanisms, geometry,\nconnection between low and high redshift active galaxies or the validity of the\nunification scenario.

It is shown analytically and numerically that small perturbations\nof solutions of the KdV-equation introduce effects of dispersion, hence the\nperturbation propagates with a different velocity then the unperturbed\nsolution. This effect is investigated analytically by formulating a\ndifferential equation for perturbations of solutions of the KdV-equation. This\ndifferential equation is solved generally using an Inverse Scattering Technique\n(IST) using the continuous part of the spectrum of the Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation. It is shown explicitly that the perturbation consist of two parts.\nThe first part represents the time-evolution of the perturbation only. The\nsecond part represents the interaction between the perturbation and the\nunperturbed solution. It is shown explicitly that singular non-dispersive\nsolutions of the KdV-equation are unstable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 May 1996 12:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
