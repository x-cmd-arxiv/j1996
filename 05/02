We focus on the\nminimal frequency of the phonon spectrum and the corresponding generalized\neigenfunction. Using an exact decimation scheme, the eigenfunctions are shown\nto have nontrivial scaling properties not only at the pinning transition point\nbut also in the cantorus regime. Therefore the phonons defy localization and\nremain critical even where the associated area-preserving map has a positive\nLyapunov exponent. In this region, the critical scaling properties vary\ncontinuously and are described by a line of renormalization limit cycles.\nInteresting renormalization bifurcation diagrams are obtained by monitoring the\ncycles as the parameters of the system are varied from an integrable case to\nthe anti-integrable limit. Both of these limits are described by a trivial\ndecimation fixed point. Very surprisingly we find additional special parameter\nvalues in the cantorus regime where the renormalization limit cycle degenerates\ninto the above trivial fixed point. At these ``degeneracy points'' the phonon\nhull is represented by an infinite series of step functions. This novel\nbehavior persists in the extended version of the model containing two\nharmonics.

Unfortunately, a spacetime with Killing vectors will be unable to\nsupply the full quota of four scalars of this type. However, for such a\nspacetime additional scalars are supplied by the components of the Killing\nvectors; by using these alongside the spin coefficients and the Riemann tensor\ncomponents we have the possibility of constructing the full quota of four\nfunctionally independent zero-weighted scalars, and of exploiting Held's\nprocedure.\n  As an illustration we investigate the vacuum Type N spaces admitting a\nKilling vector and a homothetic Killing vector. In a direct manner, we reduce\nthe problem to a pair of ordinary differential operator `master equations',\nmaking use of a new zero-weighted GHP operator. By first rewriting the master\nequations as a closed set of complex first order equations, we reduce the\nproblem to one real third order operator differential equation for a complex\nfunction of a real variable --- but with still the freedom to choose explicitly\nour fourth coordinate. An alternative, more algorithmic approach, using a\nclosed chain of real first order equations for real functions, reduces the\nproblem to the same order, but in a more natural and much more concise form. It\nis also outlined how the various other third order differential equations,\nwhich have been derived previously by other workers on this problem, can be\ndeduced from our master equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 May 1996 11:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
