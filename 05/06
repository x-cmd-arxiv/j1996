While at strong coupling the dynamics in these two models is\nessentially different, it is shown that the models become equivalent at weak\ncoupling. In particular, at weak coupling, as the strength of the magnetic\nfield goes to infinity, both the supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric\nNambu-Jona-Lasinio models are reduced to a continuum set of independent\n(1+1)-dimensional Gross-Neveu models, labeled by the coordinates in the plane\nperpendicular to the magnetic field.
