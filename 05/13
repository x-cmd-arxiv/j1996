As a consequence of\nsuch a choice of the measure, the matter lagrangian $L_{m}$ can be changed by\nadding a constant while no gravitational effects, like a cosmological term, are\ninduced.

Given the two reduction\nschemes plus duality transformations at special points of the scalar modulus\nspace, one may relate most of the $p$-brane solutions of relevance to\nsuperstring theory. We argue that the maximum classifying duality symmetry for\nthis purpose is the Weyl group of the corresponding Cremmer-Julia supergravity\nsymmetry $E_{r(+r)}$. We also discuss a separate class of duality-invariant\n$p$-branes with $p=D-3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 1996 03:08:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 1996 19:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}
