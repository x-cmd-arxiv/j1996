We show that dynamical tidal excitation of\ng-modes in the B star can be responsible for the orbital decay. However, to\nexplain the observed short decay timescale, the B star must have some\nsignificant retrograde rotation with respect to the orbit --- The retrograde\nrotation brings lower-order g-modes, which couple much more strongly to the\ntidal potential, into closer ``resonances'' with the orbital motion, thus\nsignificantly enhancing the dynamical tide. A much less likely possibility is\nthat the g-mode damping time is much shorter than the ordinary radiative\ndamping time. The observed orbital decay timescale combined with a generic\norbital evolution model based on dynamical tide can be used as a ``timer'',\ngiving an upper limit of $1.4$ Myr for the age of the binary system since the\nneutron star formation. Thus the characteristic age of the pulsar is not a good\nage indicator.

These\ntheories are interesting in that no dynamical superpotential is generated in\nthe absence of perturbations. For the example SU(4)xSU(3)xU(1) we explicitly\ndemonstrate that all flat directions can be lifted through a renormalizable\nsuperpotential and that supersymmetry is dynamically broken. We derive the\nexact superpotential for this theory, which exhibits new and interesting\ndynamical phenomena. For example, modifications to classical constraints can be\nfield dependent. We also consider the generalization to SU(n)xSU(3)xU(1) models\n(with even n>4). We present a renormalizable superpotential which lifts all\nflat directions. Because SU(3) is not confining in the absence of\nperturbations, the analysis of supersymmetry breaking is very different in\nthese theories from the n=4 example. When the SU(n) gauge group confines, the\nYukawa couplings drive the SU(3) theory into a regime with a dynamically\ngenerated superpotential. By considering a simplified version of these theories\nwe argue that supersymmetry is probably broken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 May 1996 01:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-15"}
