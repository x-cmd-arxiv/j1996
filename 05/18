Here we present a spectral analysis of all the\nX-ray sources to investigate claims that the average source spectra harden at\nfaint X-ray flux. From a hardness ratio analysis we confirm that the average\nspectra from 0.5-2 keV harden from an equivalent photon index of $\\Gamma=2.2$\nat S_(0.5-2keV)=1x10^-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2 to $\\Gamma=1.7$ below 1x10^-14 erg s^-1\ncm^-2. These spectral changes are due to the emergence of an unidentified\nsource population rather than the class of X-ray QSOs already identified. The\n128 QSOs detected so far show no evidence for spectral hardening over this\nenergy range and retain a mean photon index of $\\Gamma=2.2$. Recent work\nsuggests that many of the remaining unidentified sources are X-ray luminous\ngalaxies. Taking a subset identified as the most likely galaxy candidates we\nfind that these show significantly harder spectra than QSOs. The emission line\ngalaxies in particular show spectra more consistent with the residual X-ray\nbackground, with $\\Gamma=1.51 \\pm 0.1$ from 0.1-2 keV. Individually the\ngalaxies appear to be a mixture of absorbed and unabsorbed X-ray sources.\nCombined with recent cross-correlation results and work on the source number\ncount distribution, these results suggest that we may be uncovering the missing\nhard component of the cosmic X-ray background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 May 1996 16:14:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 May 1996 13:54:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
