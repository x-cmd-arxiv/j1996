In\nparticular, the photoionization cross section becomes anisotropic and strongly\npolarization dependent. In a number of previous works based on the adiabatic\napproximation the conclusion was drawn that the transverse cross section\nvanishes for frequencies smaller than the electron cyclotron frequency. In\nother works (which employed a different form of the interaction operator)\nappreciable finite values were obtained. An adequate interpretation of the\nneutron star thermal-like radiation requires a resolution of this controversy.\n  In this work the atomic wave functions for both discrete and continuum states\nare calculated by solving the coupled channel equations allowing the admixture\nbetween different Landau levels, which provides much higher accuracy than the\nadiabatic approximation. This enables to resolve the above contradiction in\nfavour of the finite transverse cross sections. The non-adiabatic treatment of\nthe continuum includes coupling between closed and open channels, which leads\nto the autoionization of quasi-bound energy levels associated with the electron\ncyclotron excitations and gives rise to Beutler - Fano resonances of the\nphotoionization cross section. Autoionization widths of these quasi-bound\nlevels are calculated and compared with the radiative widths. The results are\nimportant for investigations of the radiation emergent from the surface layers\nof neutron stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 May 1996 05:58:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The\nmethod is valid for deterministic or stochastic Markov dynamics, and for\nstationary or time-dependent distributions. A practical Rayleigh-Ritz procedure\nis advanced, whose inputs are finitely-parametrized ansatz for the trial\nstates, leading to a ``parametric action'' for their evolution. The\nEuler-Lagrange equations of the action principle are Hamiltonian in form\n(generally noncanonical). This permits a simple identification of fixed points\nas critical points of the parametric Hamiltonian. We also establish a\nvariational principle for low-order statistics, such as mean values and\ncorrelation functions, by means of {\\em least effective action.} The latter is\na functional of the given variable, which is positive and convex as a\nconsequence of H\\\"{o}lder realizability inequalities. Its value measures the\n``cost'' for a fluctuation from the average to occur and in a weak-noise limit\nit reduces to the Onsager-Machlup action. In general, the effective action is\nshown to arise from the nonequilibrium action functional by a constrained\nvariation. This result provides a Rayleigh-Ritz scheme for calculating just the\ndesired low-order statistics, with internal consistency checks less demanding\nthan for the full distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 May 1996 19:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The\nprocess is further elaborated by applying to the symmetric random trimer model\nwhich contains in it many hitherto known models of this category. An\nalternative mathematical definition of the exceptional energy ($E_S$) from the\ninvariant measure density along with physical arguments substantiating it is\npresented.
