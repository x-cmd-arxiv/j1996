Both methods are designed to accommodate intrinsic scatter\nin addition to measurement errors. The first (BCES) is a direct extension of\nthe ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator to allow for measurement errors. It\nis quite general, allowing a) for measurement errors on both variables, b) the\nmeasurement errors for the two variables to be dependent, c) the magnitudes of\nthe measurement errors to depend on the measurements, and d) other `symmetric'\nlines such as the bisector and the orthogonal regression can be constructed.\nThe second method is a weighted least squares (WLS) estimator, which applies\nonly in the case where the `independent' variable is measured without error and\nthe magnitudes of the measurement errors on the 'dependent' variable are\nindependent from the measurements. Several applications are made to\nextragalactic astronomy: The BCES method, when applied to data describing the\ncolor-luminosity relations for field galaxies, yields significantly different\nslopes than OLS and other estimators used in the literature. Simulations with\nartificial data sets are used to evaluate the small sample performance of the\nestimators. Unsurprisingly, the least-biased results are obtained when color is\ntreated as the dependent variable. The Tully-Fisher relation is another example\nwhere the BCES method should be used because errors in luminosity and velocity\nare correlated due to inclination corrections. We also find, via simulations,\nthat the WLS method is by far the best method for the Tolman surface-brightness\ntest, producing the smallest variance in slope by an order of magnitude.\nMoreover, with WLS it is not necessary to ``reduce'' galaxies to a fiducial\nsurface-brightness, since this model incorporates intrinsic scatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 1996 13:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The kinetic energy of\nthe particles is converted into thermal energy in a forward shock and a reverse\nshock, when the outward flowing particles encounter the interstellar medium.\nThe thermal energy is radiated via synchrotron emission and Comptonization. We\nestimate the synchrotron cooling time scale of the shocked regions for\nelectrons of various Lorentz factors, focusing in particular on those electrons\nwhose radiation falls within the energy detection range of the BATSE detectors.\nWe find that in order to produce the rapid variability observed in most bursts\nthe magnetic energy density in the shocked material must be greater than about\n1\\% of the thermal energy density. Additionally, the electrons must be nearly\nin equipartition with the protons, otherwise the radiative efficiency is low.\nInverse Compton scattering can increase the cooling rate of the relevant\nelectrons but the Comptonized emission itself is never within the BATSE range.\nThese arguments allow us to pinpoint the conditions within the radiating\nregions in GRBs and to determine the important radiation processes. In\naddition, the model predicts that the duty cycle of intensity variations in GRB\nlight curves should be nearly independent of burst duration, and should scale\ninversely as the square root of the observed photon energy.

We assume technicolor-like scenario for inducing the $W$ mass and an\neffective four fermi operator for inducing the top-quark mass. We also assume\nthat only this four fermi operator is relevant at low energy. Then we estimate\nin detail the strength $G$ and the intrinsic mass scale $M$ of the four fermi\noperator. Unitarity bound is used to quantify the strength of $G$. We find that\n$G/4\\pi \\sim {\\cal O}(1)$ and that $M$ is of the order of $\\Lambda_{TC} \\simeq\n1 \\sim 2$~TeV or less. Namely the four fermi operator cannot be treated as\n`point-like' around the electroweak scale. Furthermore we estimate the\ncontribution of the four fermi operator to the $T$ parameter. We find that the\nQCD correction to the top-quark mass function reduces the contribution to the\n$T$ parameter by about 40\\%. By comparing the results with the present\nexperimental bound, we obtain another upper bound on $M$ which is typically in\nseveral to 10~TeV region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 May 1996 15:08:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 May 1996 14:37:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
