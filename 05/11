This implies that the amplitude $\\phi^*$ of the Schechter function\nscales with the sample depth, as confirmed by various observational data. This\neffect is analogous to the scaling of the space density due to the fractal\nnature of the space distribution. This has the important consequence that the\nluminosity function can be properly defined only in a volume limited sample.\nAlso the so-called \"luminosity segregation\" and the concept of bias correspond\nto a natural consequence of multifractality.
