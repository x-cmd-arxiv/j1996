Existing\nradio data on the {\\it arc} support the view that its synchrotron emission\noriginates from cooling, initially monoenergetic electrons which diffuse and\nconvect from their sources to the outer extensions of the {\\it arc}. If the\nsource of high-energy electrons coincides with the sickle region (G0.18-0.04),\nas indicated by the radio data, then the ambient far- infrared photons can be\nup-scattered to \\grs by inverse-Compton inter- action with the young\nhigh-energy electrons. We solve the continuity equation for the electrons\nincluding terms for diffusion, convection, monoenergetic injection, and the\nfull energy loss.

Several gross properties with respect to the GT transitions are\ninvestigated with this set of the wavefunctions and the operator. While the\ncalculated total GT$^-$ strengths show no apparent disagreement with the\nmeasured ones, the calculated total GT$^+$ strengths are somewhat larger than\nthose obtained from charge-exchange experiments. Concerning the Ikeda sum-rule,\nthe proportionality of $S_{\\rm GT}$ to $(N-Z)$ persists to an excellent\napproximation, with a quenching factor of 0.68. For the relative GT$^-$\nstrengths among possible isospin components, the lowest isospin component\ngathers greater fraction than expected by the squared CG coefficients of the\nisospin coupling. It turns out that these relative strengths are insensitive to\nthe size of model space. Systematics of the summed $B({\\rm GT})$ values are\ndiscussed for each isospin component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 May 1996 04:47:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
