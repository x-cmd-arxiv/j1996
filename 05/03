It is found that for minimally coupled and conformally coupled scalar\nfields the respective stress-energy tensors are unbounded in the horizon. The\nspecific form of the divergences suggests that when the semiclassical Einstein\nequations describing the backreaction of the quantum fields on the spacetime\ngeometry are taken into account, the horizon will acquire a curvature\nsingularity. Thus the Killing-Cauchy horizon which is known to be unstable\nunder ``generic\" classical perturbations is also unstable by vacuum\npolarization. The calculation is done following the point splitting\nregularization technique. The dynamical colliding wave spacetime has four quite\ndistinct spacetime regions, namely, one flat region, two single plane wave\nregions, and one interaction region. Exact mode solutions of the quantum field\nequation cannot be found exactly, but the blueshift suffered by the initial\nmodes in the plane wave and interaction regions makes the use of the WKB\nexpansion a suitable method of solution.
