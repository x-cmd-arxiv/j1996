The usual notion of `history' is generalized to the notion of `effect\nhistory'. The space of effect histories carries the structure of a D-poset.\nRecent results of J.D. Maitland Wright imply that every decoherence functional\ndefined for ordinary histories can be uniquely extended to a bi-additive\ndecoherence functional on the space of effect histories. Omnes' logical\ninterpretation is generalized to the present context. The result of this work\nconsiderably generalizes and simplifies the earlier formulation of the\nconsistent effect histories approach to quantum mechanics communicated in a\nprevious work of this author.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 May 1996 11:33:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jun 1996 11:39:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
