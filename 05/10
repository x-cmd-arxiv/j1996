It is shown how these radiative torques may be\ncalculated using the discrete dipole approximation. Calculations are carried\nout for one irregular grain geometry, and three different grain sizes. It is\nshown that radiative torques can play an important dynamical role in spinup of\ninterstellar dust grains, resulting in rotation rates which may exceed even\nthose expected from H_2 formation on the grain surface. Because the radiative\ntorque on an interstellar grain is determined by the overall grain geometry\nrather than merely the state of the grain surface, the resulting superthermal\nrotation is expected to be long-lived. By itself, long-lived superthermal\nrotation would permit grain alignment by normal paramagnetic dissipation on the\n\"Davis-Greenstein\" timescale. However, radiative torques arising from\nanisotropy of the starlight background can act directly to alter the grain\nalignment on much shorter timescales, and are therefore central to the process\nof interstellar grain alignment.\n  Radiative torques depend strongly on the grain size, measured by a_eff, the\nradius of a sphere of equal volume. In diffuse clouds, radiative torques\ndominate the torques due to H2 formation for a_eff=0.2micron grains, but are\nrelatively unimportant for a_eff<0.05micron grains. This may provide a natural\nexplanation for the observation that $a_eff>0.1 micron grains in diffuse clouds\nare aligned, while there is little alignment of a_eff < 0.05 micron grains.

This effective action is\nshown to reproduce the familiar perturbative expansion for the two and four\npoint functions. In particular, in the case of fermionic vector models, the\neffective action correctly accounts for the Fermi statistics. The theory is\nalso studied non-perturbatively. The stationary points of the effective action\nare shown to provide the usual large $N$ gap equations. The homogeneous\nequation associated with the quadratic (in the bilocals) action is simply the\ntwo particle Bethe Salpeter equation. Finally, the leading correction in\n$1\\over N$ is shown to be in agreement with the exact $S$ matrix of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 1996 08:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 1996 22:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Shelah establishes different preservation theorems for each of\nthese three posets (the theorem for Namba forcing is particularly intricate).\nWe establish a general preservation theorem for a variant of RCS iterations\nwhich includes all three posets in a straightforward way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 May 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
