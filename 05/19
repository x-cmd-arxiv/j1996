The gas layer of NGC 4244 is rather symmetric in\nall respects, i.e. the surface density distribution, flaring and warping, so\nthat the rotation curve (RC) is determined accurately, despite the fact that\ni~90^o. The RC rises slowly in the inner 6 kpc, is ~ constant at 100 km/s out\nto 10kpc, and decreases in Keplerian fashion by 15% at the last measured point\nat 14 kpc. The RC constrains the stellar mass-to-light ratio to lie between 50\nand 100% of the ``maximum-disk'' value.\n  A new technique is presented to determine simultaneously the inclination and\nthe thickness of the gas layer from HI observations which uses the apparent\nwidths at many channels and works for i >= 60^o. The inclination of the un-\nwarped disk is about 84.5 degrees: beyond D25/2 the inclination changes gra-\ndually till 82.5^o, while at large radii the disk seems to warp back to the\nplane defined by the inner disk. The gaseous velocity dispersion is roughly\nconstant within the optical disk (8.5+/-1 km/s) and increases slightly beyond.\n  The thickness of the gas layer increases gradually from 0.4 to 1.5 kpc.

Here this method is applied to the\nalmost edge-on Scd galaxy NGC 4244 for which the necessary parameters are\ndetermined in the accompanying paper (AJ, Aug. 1996; astro-ph/9605110).\n  The observed flaring of the HI beyond the optical disk puts significant\nconstraints on the shape of the dark matter halo, which are almost independent\nof the stellar mass-to-light ratio. NGC 4244's dark matter halo is found to be\nhighly flattened with a shortest-to-longest axis ratio of 0.2 (-0.1)(+0.3). If\nthe dark matter is disk-like, the data presented in this paper imply that the\nvertical velocity dispersion of the dark matter must be 10% - 30% larger than\nthe measured tangential dispersion in the HI. Alternatively, the measured\nflaring curve is consistent with a round halo if the gaseous velocity\ndispersion ellipsoid is anisotropic. In that case the vertical dispersion of\nthe gas is 50 - 70% of the measured tangential velocity dispersion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 May 1996 17:27:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In order to solve this problem, we present\na simple model of chemical evolution for elliptical galaxies after the galactic\nwind period under the assumption that the gases ejected from stars do not mix\nwith the circumferential gas. The ejected gas components evolve separately\naccording to their birth time and origin. We have investigated their evolution\nqualitatively. The gas components originated from supernova remnant shells cool\nand drop out of the hot gas faster than the other components because of their\nhigh density and metal abundance. As a result, supernovae cannot heat the whole\ngas of the elliptical galaxies effectively, in contrary to the previous\nresults. If the metal abundance of mass-loss gas is not uniform, the mass-loss\ngas with higher abundance also easily drops out and the average abundance can\ndecrease. We believe that this is a hint of solving the low abundance problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 May 1996 13:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We calculated the linear conductance of the system, the profile of\nthe electric field and the densities of states. In the case of transparent\nmetallic boundaries the temperature dependent conductance has a non-monotoneous\n``reentrant'' structure. We argue that this behavior is due to nonequilibrium\neffects occuring in the normal metal in the presence of both superconducting\ncorrelations and the electric field there. Low transparent tunnel barriers\nsuppress the nonequilibrium effects and destroy the reentrant behavior of the\nconductance. If the wire contains a loop, the conductance shows Aharonov-Bohm\noscillations with the period $\\Phi_0=h/2e$ as a function of the magnetic flux\n$\\Phi$ inside the loop. The amplitude of these oscillations also demonstrates\nthe reentrant behavior vanishing at $T=0$ and decaying as $1/T$ at relatively\nlarge temperatures. The latter behavior is due to low energy correlated\nelectrons which penetrate deep into the normal metal and ``feel'' the effect of\nthe magnetic flux $\\Phi$. We point out that the density of states and thus the\n``strengh'' of the proximity effect can be tuned by the value of the flux\ninside the loop.
