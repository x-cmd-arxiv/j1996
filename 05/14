A formal fit to the HI kinematics in the ring is\nconsistent with both ring rotation and expansion (expansion velocity 32 km/s).\nHowever, H\\,I in the northeast quadrant of the ring is severely disturbed,\nshowing evidence of tidal interaction.

Nonlinear differential equations for ${\\cal F}$ including\nthe Witten -- Dijkgraaf -- Verlinde -- Verlinde equation are obtained. This\nindicates that $N=2$ SYM theories are essentially topological field theories\nand that should be seen as low-energy limit of some topological string theory.\nFurthermore, we construct relevant modular invariant quantities, derive\ncanonical relations between the periods and investigate the structure of the\nbeta function by giving its explicit form in the moduli coordinates. In doing\nthis we discuss the uniformization problem for the quantum moduli space. The\nmethod we propose can be generalized to $N=2$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheories with higher rank gauge groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 May 1996 17:37:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 May 1996 08:13:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 May 1996 06:39:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 21 May 1996 17:30:37 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 1996 17:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
