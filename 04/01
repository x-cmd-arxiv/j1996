Clustering\nsystems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality\nand the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the\nsearch strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but\nbe computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both\nways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs\na `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative\noptimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings.\nGiven this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial\nclusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative\noptimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search\nof a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative\noptimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been\nconstructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific\ncriteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic\nperformance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over\ncompleted patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this\nperformance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by\nsupervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical\nclusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we\npropose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures\nfor decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and\nsimplicity dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Apr 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

These models have been used to study he\nbehavior of this compartment under such pathological clinical conditions s\nhydrocephalus, head injury and brain edema. The number of different pproaches\nhas led to considerable confusion regarding the validity, accuracy or\nappropriateness of the various models. In this paper we review the mathematical\nbasis for these models in a mplified fashion, leaving the mathematical details\nto appendices. We show at most previous models are in fact particular cases of\na single basic differential equation describing the evolution in time of the\ncerebrospinal fluid pressure (CFS). Central to this approach is the hypothsis\nthat the rate change of CSF volume with respect to pressure is a measure of the\ncompliance of the brain tissue which as a consequence leads to particular\nmodels epending on the form of the compliance funtion. All such models in fact\ngive essentially no information on the behavior of the brain itself. More\nrecent models (solved numerically using the Finite Element Method) have begun\nto address this issue but have difficulties due to the lack of information\nabout the mechanical properties of the brain.
