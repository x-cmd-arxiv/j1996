This leads to stellar strange-matter configurations\nwhose properties are much more complex than those of the conventional sequence.\nAs an example, two generically different categories of stable strange dwarfs\nare found, which could be the observed white dwarfs. Furthermore we find very\nlow-mass strange stellar objects, with masses as small as those of Jupiter or\neven lighter planets. Such objects, if abundant enough in our Galaxy, should be\nseen by the presently performed gravitational microlensing searches.

The ``effective potential\"\nanalysis enables us to classify the particle orbits into four types as follows.\nWhen the total angular momentum $J$ is large, some orbits are bounded and the\n``effective potential\"s are classified into two types: (B1) one saddle point\n(unstable circular orbit) and one minimal point (stable circular orbit) on the\nequatorial plane exist for small spin; and (B2) two saddle points bifurcate\nfrom the equatorial plane and one minimal point remains on the equatorial plane\nfor large spin.
