Such shocks, which may be either collisional or\ncollisionless, can contribute to the observed high energy temporal and spectral\nvariability. Our Rationale is the following: Observations show that the\ncontinuum emission probably originates in an optically thin, hot plasma in the\nAGN central engine. The flux and spectrum from this hot plasma varies\nsignificantly over light crossing timescales. several authors have suggested\nthat macroscopic perturbations contained within this plasma are the sources of\nthis variability. In order to produce the observed emission the perturbations\nmust be radiatively coupled with the optically thin hot matter and must also\nmove with high velocities. We suggest that shocks, which can be very effective\nin randomizing the bulk motion of the perturbations, are responsible for this\ncoupling. Shocks should form in the central engine, because the temperatures\nand magnetic fields are probably reduced below their virial values by radiative\ndissipation. Perturbations moving at Keplerian speeds, or strong nonlinear\nexcitations, result in supersonic and super-Alfvenic velocities leading to\nshock waves whithin the hot plasma\n  We Show that even a perturbation significantly smaller than the emitting\nregion can form a shock which significantly modifies the continuum emission in\nan AGN, and that the spectral and temporal variability from such a shock\ngenerally resemble those of radio quiet AGN.

The method, first developed in\nRuiz--Lapuente \\& Lucy (1992), makes use here of an improved modeling of the\nforbidden line emission at late phases. Hydrodynamic models of the explosion of\nWDs of different masses, both sub--Chandrasekhar and Chandrasekhar, provide the\nbasis for comparison with the observations. It is shown that it is possible to\nprobe the overall density structure of the ejecta and the mass of the exploding\nWD by the effect that the electron density profile has in shaping the forbidden\nline emission of the iron ions, and that a robust diagnostic of the mass of the\nexploding WD can be obtained. Cosmic distance scale can thus be related to\nbasic diagnostics of excitation of iron lines.

The line-defect\nmicrostructure is described in terms of a spatially coarse-grained order\nparameter, the dislocation density tensor. The tensor field satisfies a\nconservation law that derives from the conservation of Burgers vector.\nDislocation motion is entirely dissipative and is assumed to be locally driven\nby the minimization of plastic free energy. We first outline the method and\nresulting equations of motion to linear order in the dislocation density\ntensor, obtain various stationary solutions, and give their geometric\ninterpretation. The coupling of the dislocation density to an externally\nimposed stress field is also addressed, as well as the impact of the field on\nthe stationary solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Apr 1996 20:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
