In the introduction\nwe discuss a wide range of recent work on this subject and give some\nreferences. In the body of the paper, we discuss Corlette's nonabelian Hodge\ntheorem, Hitchin's quaternionic structure on the moduli space of\nrepresentations of $\\pi _1(X)$ (for a compact K\\\"ahler manifold $X$), and\nDeligne's construction of the resulting twistor space. We then mention the\ninterpretation of Deligne's space of $\\lambda$-connections as the Hodge\nfiltration of the nonabelian de Rham cohomology $M_{DR}(X,G)= H^1(X,G)$. We go\non to prove several properties of this Hodge filtration, such as Griffiths\ntransversality and regularity of the Gauss-Manin connection; a local triviality\nproperty coming from Goldman and Millson's analysis of the singularities; and a\nweight property coming from Langton's theory. We construct a compactification\nof $M_{DR}$ using the Hodge filtration with its weight property. At the end, we\ndefine a nonabelian version of the Noether-Lefschetz locus, and prove that it\nis algebraic if the base of the fibration is compact. We pose the open problem\nof studying degenerations of nonabelian Hodge structure sufficiently well to be\nable to prove algebraicity of the Noether-Lefshetz locus even when the base is\nquasiprojective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 1996 10:22:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Kustaanheimo--Stiefel\n(KS) regularization is widely used to remove the singularity in the equations\nof motion, making it possible to integrate orbits having very high\neccentricity.

We\npresent a new time-integration algorithm which has no secular error in either\nthe binding energy or the eccentricity, while allowing variable stepsize.

The 2k_F-periodic density profile away\nfrom the barrier (Friedel oscillation) is computed for arbitrary\nelectron--electron interaction and arbitrary impurity strength. We find that in\npresence of correlations, the Friedel oscillation decays slower than predicted\nby Fermi liquid theory. In the case of a spinless Luttinger liquid\ncharacterized by an interaction constant g<1, the asymptotic decay of the\nFriedel oscillation is x^-g. For a weak scatterer, the decay is even slower at\nsmall-to-intermediate distances from the impurity, with a crossover to the\nasymptotic x^-g law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Apr 1996 10:37:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
