In\nconcrete situations this regular hull appears more often than the composition\nitself. As a first example we obtain a description for the regular hull of the\nnuclear operators which is a \"reflected\" Grothendieck representation:\\\\\n$\\oid{N}{}{reg} \\stackrel{1}{=} \\oid{I}{}{} \\circ \\oid{W}{}{}$ (theorem 2.1).\nFurther we recognize that the class of such ideals leads to interesting\nrelations concerning the question of the accessibility of (injective) operator\nideals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
