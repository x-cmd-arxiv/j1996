The accretion discs are assumed to be geometrically thin, and of low\nmass relative to the stellar mass so that they are governed by thermal pressure\nand viscosity, but not self-gravity. The parameters that we consider in our\nmodels are the ratio of the orbital distance to the disc radius, D/R, the\nbinary mass ratio, the initial inclination angle between the orbit and disc\nplanes and the Mach number in the outer parts of the unperturbed disc. For\nbinary mass ratios of around unity and D/R in the range 3 to 4, we find that\nthe global evolution of the discs is governed primarily by the value of the\nMach number. For relatively low Mach numbers (i.e. 10 to 20) we find that the\ndiscs develop a mildly warped structure, are tidally truncated, and undergo a\nnear rigid body precession at a rate which is in close agreement with\nanalytical arguments. For higher Mach numbers (approx. 30), the evolution is\ntowards a considerably more warped structure, but the disc none the less\nmaintains itself as a long-lived, coherent entity.

We have\nextended this analysis into redshift-space and found a solution for the\nnonlinear, anisotropic redshift-space power spectrum in the limit of\nplane--parallel redshift distortions.

Not only the total $M1$ but also the spin and orbital\nparts separately are studied. The single-particle energies are first calculated\nwith the same interaction that is used between the valence nucleons. Later this\nstringent condition is relaxed somewhat and the $1s$ level is raised relative\nto $0d$. For nuclei up to $^{28}Si$, much better results i.e stronger $B(M1)$\nrates are obtained by increasing the strength of the spin-orbit interaction\nrelative to the free value. This is probably also true for $^{32}S$, but\n$^{36}Ar$ presents some difficulties. The effects of weakening the tensor\ninteraction are also studied. On a more subtle level, the optimum spin-orbit\ninteraction in the lower half of the $s-d$ shell, as far as $M1$ excitations\nare concerned, is substantially larger than the difference\n$E(J=3/2^+)_1-E(J=5/2^+)_1=5.2~MeV$ in $^{17}O$. A larger spin-orbit splitting\nis also needed to destroy the triaxiality in $^{22}Ne$.
