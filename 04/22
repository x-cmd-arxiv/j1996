A razor-thin disk with even a very small\ndegree of random motion in the plane is both unstable and possesses a discrete\nspectrum of neutral modes, irrespective of the sharpness of the edge. Random\nmotion normal to the disk plane has a stabilizing effect but at the same time\nallows bending waves to couple to the internal vibrations of the particles,\nwhich causes the formerly neutral modes to decay through Landau damping.\n  Focusing first on instabilities, I here determine the degree of random motion\nnormal to the plane needed to suppress global, axisymmetric, bending\ninstabilities in a family of self-gravitating disks. As found previously,\nbending instabilities are suppressed only when the thickness exceeds that\nexpected from a na\\\"\\i ve local criterion when the degree of pressure support\nwithin the disk plane is comparable to, or exceeds, the support from rotation.\nA modest disk thickness is adequate for the bending stability of most disk\ngalaxies, except perhaps near their centers.\n  The discretization of the neutral spectrum in a zero-thickness disk is due to\nthe existence of a turning point for bending waves in a warm disk, which is\nabsent when the disk is cold. When the disk is given a finite thickness, the\ndiscrete neutral modes generally become strongly damped through wave-particle\ninteractions. It is surprising therefore that I find some simulations of warm,\nstable disks can support (quasi-)neutral, large-scale, bending modes that decay\nvery slowly, if at all.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Apr 1996 20:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

It is also pointed out that the decay rate $\\Gamma (H\\rightarrow\nZ_{L}Z_{L})$ is fairly insensitive to the other heavier Higgs masses and is\npossibly a good measuring tool of the Higgs mixing angle. The mechanism of\nthese screening phenomena in the Higgs decays is explained on the basis of a\nnew screening theorem, which we postulate with reference to the custodial\nsymmetry in the Higgs potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 1996 10:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
