In our previous investigation it was shown that such\nbackground is stable in dimensions higher than four provided the amplitudes of\n``magnetic fields'' do not differ much from each other. In present paper we\ncalculate exactly the relevant zeta-functions in the case of equal amplitudes\nof ``magnetic fields''. For the case of two ``magnetic fields'' with equal\namplitudes the behavior of the effective action is studied in detail. It is\nshown that in dimensions $d=4,5,6,7$ $({\\rm mod}\\, 8)$, the perturbative vacuum\nis metastable, i.e., it is stable in perturbation theory but the effective\naction is not bounded from below, whereas in dimensions $d=9,10,11$ $({\\rm\nmod}\\, 8)$ the perturbative vacuum is absolutely stable. In dimensions $d=8$\n$({\\rm mod}\\, 8)$ the perturbative vacuum is stable for small values of\ncoupling constant but becomes unstable for large coupling constant leading to\nthe formation of a non-perturbative stable vacuum with nonvanishing ``magnetic\nfields''. The critical value of the coupling constant and the amplitudes of the\nvacuum ``magnetic fields'' are evaluated exactly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 1996 10:50:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

In\nthe case of atomic nuclei, exemplified by 12C and 40Ca, the standard\nliquid-drop results are reproduced at low temperatures and a phase\ntransformation to a fragment gas occurs as the temperature is raised.
