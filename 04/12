The two players\nsimultaneously make their moves, and are then informed of each other's moves.\nPayoff is determined by a Borel measurable function $f$ on the set of possible\nresulting sequences of moves. A standard result in Game Theory is that finite\ngames of this type are determined. Blackwell proved that infinite games are\ndetermined, but only for the cases where the payoff function is the indicator\nfunction of an open or $G_\\delta$ set. For games of perfect information,\ndeterminacy has been proven for games of arbitrary Borel complexity.\n  In this paper I prove the determinacy of Blackwell games over a\n$G_{\\delta\\sigma}$ set, in a manner similar to Davis' proof of determinacy of\ngames of $G_{\\delta\\sigma}$ complexity of perfect information. There is also\nextensive literature about the consequences of assuming AD, the axiom that\n_all_ such games of perfect information are determined. In the final section of\nthis paper I formulate an analogous axiom for games of imperfect information,\nand explore some of the consequences of this axiom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
