For hypersurfaces a stronger result holds because these\nperturbations describe a complex vector space of $\\C^{n}$.\n  For a big analytic disc the defect does not need to be smaller than the\ncodimension of the manifold. Indeed we show by an example that it can be\narbitrarily large independently of the codimension of the manifold.\nNevertheless we also prove that the defect is always finite.
