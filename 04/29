From the amplitude of the\ngalaxy surface brightness fluctuations, we also estimate the number of globular\nclusters fainter than this cutoff magnitude.

The\ncircuit presented employs a double `classical' code, i.e., one for bit flips\nand one for phase shifts. An implementation of this coding circuit on an\nion-trap quantum computer is described that requires 26 laser pulses. A further\ncircuit is presented requiring only 24 laser pulses, making it an efficient\nprotection scheme against arbitrary 1-qubit errors. In addition, the\nperformance of two error correction schemes, one based on the quantum Zeno\neffect and the other using standard methods, is compared. The quantum Zeno\nerror correction scheme is found to fail completely for a model of noise based\non phase-diffusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Apr 1996 09:50:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Oct 1996 09:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The interaction of this system with the\nmeasured state can result in the final states which belong to different Hilbert\nspaces which corresponds to different values of some classical observables,i.e.\nspontaneous symmetry breaking occurs. Interference terms (IT) between such\nstates in the measurement of any Hermitian observable are infinitely small and\ndue to it the final pure states can't be distinguished from the mixed ones,\ncharacteristic for the state collapse.
