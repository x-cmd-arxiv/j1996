Phenomenology of this scenario is considered and possibility to\ncheck it in the forthcoming experiments is discussed. Scenario implies large\nvalues and inverse flavour hierarchy of the couplings of the Zee boson with\nfermions: $f_{e \\tau} \\ll f_{\\mu \\tau} \\leq f_{e \\mu} \\sim 0.1$. Main\nsignatures of scenario are: strongly suppressed signal of $\\n_\\m\\A \\n_\\tau$\noscillation in CHORUS and NOMAD experiments, so that positive result from these\nexperiments will rule out the scenario; possibility of observation of $\\n_e\\A\n\\n_\\tau$ oscillations by CHORUS and NOMAD; corrections to the muon decay,\nneutrino-electron scattering at the level of the experimental errors; branching\nratio $B(\\mu \\A e \\gamma)$ bigger than $10^{-13}$. The solar neutrino problem\ncan be solved by introduction of additional very light singlet fermion without\nappreciable changes of the active neutrino pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 1996 08:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
