An important check of this idea is that it links the Weinberg angle\nto a mass ratio of the elementary fermions. The Green-Schwarz mechanism occurs\nnaturally in many superstring compactifications, and produces a small\nparameter, which we use to determine the quark mass hierarchy. We show that\nhierarchy and mixings among the chiral fermions is a consequence of the\nGreen-Schwarz mechanism.
