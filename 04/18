The objects have been selected as QSO candidate on the\nbasis of its blue continuum and the apparent absence of strong hydrogen or\nhelium lines. One star, HE1211-1707, shows a rather fast spectral variability:\nboth the strength and the position of the shallow absorption features change on\na time scale of 20 minutes. We interpret this variability as being due to a\nmagnetic field on the surface of a rotating white dwarf, having a relatively\nuniform magnetic field on one hemisphere and a much larger spread of field\nstrengths visible during other phases of the rotational period. All attempts to\ndetermine the magnetic field structure in detail with the help of synthetic\nspectra have failed so far because the star must have a rather complicated\nfield geometry. However, both the optical and the UV spectra indicate that a\nsignificant part of the surface is dominated by a magnetic field strength of\nabout 80 MG.

The non-locality and\nenergy-dependence of the $\\Lambda$ self--energy is discussed and the effects on\nthe bound and scattering states are investigated. For the nucleon--hyperon\ninteraction, we use the potential models of the J\\\"{u}lich and Nijmegen groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 1996 09:04:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

When applying the experimental\nfilters of the MULTICS-MINIBALL apparatus, it is found that criticality signals\ncan be hidden due to the inefficiency of the experimental apparatus.
