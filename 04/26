The maximum mass and the radius of the\nneutron star agree favourably with the observations. Since finding quark matter\nrather than spin polarised nuclear matter at the core of neutron stars is more\nprobable, the proposed EOS is also applied to the study of hybrid stars. It is\nfound using the bag model picture that one can in principle describe both the\nmass and size as well as the surface magnetic field of hybrid stars\nsatisfactorily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 1996 17:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The initial and final pp distortions\nare calculated from a coupled-channel pi-NN model which describes the NN\nscattering data up to about 2 GeV. With the x-NN vertex functions taken from\nthe Bonn potential, the predicted total cross sections of threshold pp --> eta\npp reaction are in good agreement with the data. In contrast to previous works,\nwe find that the eta-exchange plays an important role. The effect of the\ntwo-pion exchange, simulated by sigma- exchange, is found to be significant but\nnot as dominant as the vector meson-exchange introduced in previous works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Apr 1996 18:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
