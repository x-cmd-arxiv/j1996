Here, we\nexamine the sensitivity of that cross section to the detailed structure of the\nprojectile and target nuclei. At the transition energies relevant to nuclear\nphysics, we find the cross section to be weakly dependent on the projectile\ncharge radius, and to be sensitive to only the leading momentum-transfer\ndependence of the target transition form factors. We exploit these facts to\nderive a quantum-mechanical ``equivalent-photon spectrum'' valid in the\nlong-wavelength limit. This improved spectrum includes the effects of\nprojectile size, the finite longitudinal momentum transfer required by\nkinematics, and the response of the target nucleus to the off-shell photon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Apr 1996 19:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
