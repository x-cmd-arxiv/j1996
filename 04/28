The first part of the review deals with formal\nproblems. We analyze the classical limit and perform semi-classical\nquantization. We show that the non-relativistic limit corresponds to the\nCalogero-Moser model with a boundary potential. We construct a lattice\nregularization of the problem via the XXZ chain. We classify boundary bound\nstates. We generalize the Destri de Vega method to compute the ground state\nenergy of the theory on a finite interval. The second part deals with some\napplications to condensed matter physics. We show how to compute analytically\ntime and space dependent correlations in one-dimensional quantum integrable\nsystems with an impurity. Our approach is based on a description of these\nsystems in terms of massless scattering of quasiparticles. Correlators follow\nthen from matrix elements of local operators between multiparticle states --\nthe massless form-factors. Although, in general an infinite sum of these\nform-factors has to be considered, we find that for the current, spin and\nenergy operators only a few (two or three) are necessary to obtain an accuracy\nof more than 1\\%. Our results hold for arbitrary impurity strength, in contrary\nto the perturbative expansions in the coupling constants. As an example, we\ncompute the frequency dependent condunctance, at zero temperature, in a\nLuttinger liquid with an impurity, and also discuss the susceptibility in the\nKondo model and the time-dependent properties of the two-state problem with\ndissipation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Apr 1996 03:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
