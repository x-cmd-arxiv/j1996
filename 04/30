We do, however, find a strong interplay between the mass\nresolution of a simulation and the microphysics included in the computation of\nheating and cooling rates.

Generalizing the other\nhalf, we characterize the measures on subshifts of finite type that are\ninvariant under both the adic and the shift as the Gibbs measures whose\npotential functions depend on only a single coordinate. There are connections\nwith and implications for exchangeability, ratio limit theorems for transient\nMarkov chains, interval splitting procedures, `canonical' Gibbs states, and the\ntriviality of remote sigma-fields finer than the usual tail field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}

In this paper we find the measurement which provides the optimal\nmutual information about the parity bit and calculate that information.
