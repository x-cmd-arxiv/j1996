The\ndetermination makes use of the same principle that allows one to measure the\nEinstein ring radii from finite-source effects. For the case when the orbital\nperiod of the source stars is much longer than the Einstein time scale, $P\\gg\nt_{\\rm e}$, there exists a single two-fold degeneracy in determining\n$\\hat{r}_{\\rm e}$. However, when $P \\lesssim t_{\\rm e}$ the degeneracy can\noften be broken by making use of the binary-source system's orbital motion.\n%Once $\\hat{r}_{\\rm e}$, and thus $\\hat{v}$ are determined, one can\n%distinguish self-lensing events in the Large Magellanic Cloud %from Galactic\nhalo events. For an identifiable 8\\% of all lensing events seen toward the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud (LMC), one can unambiguously determine whether the\nlenses are Galactic, or whether they lie in the LMC itself. The required\nobservations can be made after the event is over and could be carried out for\nthe $\\sim 8$ events seen by Alcock et al.\\ and Aubourg et al.. In addition, we\npropose to include eclipsing binaries as sources for gravitational lensing\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Apr 1996 20:07:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Jun 1996 19:36:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Solvent librations and vibrations, and\nthe H2O asymmetric stretch in particular, are found to be the most effective\npromotors of the electronic transition. Dissipation of the released energy to\nthe solvent proceeds on two time scales: a fast 10-20 fs heating of the first\nsolvation shell, where most of the energy is accepted by the librational\ndegrees of freedom, and a several hundred femtosecond global reconstruction of\nt he solvent as the first shell transfers its excess energy to the rest of the\nmolecules.
