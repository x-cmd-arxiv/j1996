Some solutions travel, but\nthose solutions that are invariant under reflections in both horizontal\ndirections cannot travel, since motion in any horizontal direction is balanced\nby an equal and opposite motion elsewhere. Equivariant bifurcation theory\nallows us to understand the steady and time-dependent ways in which a pattern\ncan travel when a mirror symmetry of the pattern is broken in a bifurcation.\nHere we study symmetry-breaking instabilities of convection with a square\nplanform. A pitchfork bifurcation leads to squares that travel uniformly, while\na Hopf bifurcation leads to a new class of oscillations in which squares drift\nto and fro but with no net motion of the pattern. Two types of travelling\nsquares are possible after a pitchfork bifurcation, and three or more\noscillatory solutions are created in a Hopf bifurcation. One of the three\noscillations, alternating pulsating waves, has been observed in recent\nnumerical simulations of convection in the presence of a magnetic field. We\nalso present a low-order model of three-dimensional compressible convection\nthat contains these symmetry-breaking instabilities. Our analysis clarifies the\nrelationship between several types of time-dependent patterns that have been\nobserved in numerical simulations of convection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Apr 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2019-10-03"}
