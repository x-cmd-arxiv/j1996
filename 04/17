In the neutral one-dimensional C60-polymer, electronic structures\nchange among direct-gap insulators and the metal, depending on the degree of\nconjugations. High pressure experiments could observe such pressure-induced\nmetal-insulator transitions. The C60-polymer doped with one electron per one\nmolecule is always a metal. The energy difference between the highest-occupied\nstate and the lowest-unoccupied state of the neutral system becomes smaller\nupon doping owing to the polaron effects. When the C60-polymer is doped with\ntwo electrons per one C60, the system is insulating. When the conjugation in\nthe direction of the polymer chain is smaller, it is a direct-gap insulator.\nThe energy gap becomes indirect when the conjugation is stronger. We also study\nthe antiferromagnetic phase of AC60 by using a tight-binding model with\nlong-range Coulomb interactions. The antiferromagnetism is well described by\nthe model. The comparison with the photoemission studies shows that the new\nband around the Fermi energy of the AC60 phase can be explaind by the extremely\nlarge intrusion of an energy level into the gap of the neutral system.

The\ntransport coefficients for average motion, friction \\gamma, inertia M and the\nlocal stiffness C are computed along a fission path of Th-224 within a\nquasi-static picture. The inverse relaxation time \\beta=\\gamma/M and the\neffective damping rate \\eta=\\gamma/(2\\sqrt{M|C|}) are found to increase with\ntemperature, but do not change much with the collective variable. The values\nfound for \\eta and \\beta as well as their behavior with temperature are in\naccord with experimental findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Apr 1996 08:43:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Apr 1996 11:39:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 1997 09:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
