In addition, our method may allow to determine the local\nmagnification caused by the deflector if the auto-correlation function is\ncaused by a large number density of faint galaxies; in this case, the intrinsic\nACF may provide a `standard source' with respect to which shear and\nmagnification can be obtained.

We derive an explicit expression for the potential\ndetermining the dynamics of the string and we present explicit expressions for\nthe string tension and energy density as a function of string-loop radius. We\nalso obtain explicit expressions for the wiggle and woggle speeds (speeds of\ntransverse and longitudinal perturbations, respectively). We show that the\ncontraction of the uniformly charged string is essentially governed by the\nstring tension (for large loop radius) and by a {\\it finite} Coulomb barrier\n(for small loop radius). We argue for the unobstructed contraction of a\nuniformly charged loop over the Coulombic barrier and its eventual collapse to\na charged point. The implication of such an effect to the possible formation of\nnaked singularities, in violation of the cosmic censorship hypothesis, is\nfinally discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 1996 22:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
