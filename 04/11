Assuming quasi-linear behaviour of\nthe field lines, the particles undergo sub-diffusion on short time scales. We\nderive the propagator for such motion, which differs from the Gaussian form\nrelevant for diffusion, and apply it to a configuration with a plane shock\nfront whose normal is perpendicular to the average field direction. Expressions\nare given for the acceleration time as a function of the diffusion coefficient\nof the wandering magnetic field lines and the spatial diffusion coefficient of\nthe charged particles parallel to the local field. In addition we calculate the\nspatial dependence of the particle density in both the upstream and downstream\nplasmas.

At this continuous equi- librium\nphase transition, the liquid state, in which all macromolecules are\ndelocalised, is transformed into a solid state, in which a nonzero fraction of\nmacromolecules have spontaneously become localised. This solid state is a most\nunusual one: localisation occurs about mean positions that are distributed\nhomogeneously and randomly, and to an extent that varies randomly from monomer\nto monomer. Thus, the solid state emerging at the vulcanisation transition is\nan equilibrium amorphous solid state: it is properly viewed as a solid state\nthat bears the same relationship to the liquid and crystalline states as the\nspin glass state of certain magnetic systems bears to the paramagnetic and\nferromagnetic states, in the sense that, like the spin glass state, it is\ndiagnosed by a subtle order parameter.\n  In this review we give a detailed exposition of a theoretical approach to the\nphysical properties of systems of randomly, permanently crosslinked\nmacromolecules. Our primary focus is on the equilibrium properties of such\nsystems, especially in the regime of Goodyear's vulcanisation transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Apr 1996 19:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
