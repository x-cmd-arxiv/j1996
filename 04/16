In contrast with the periodic case, only\ncharges corresponding to interactions of even number of spins exist for the\nopen chain. Hence, there are half as many charges in the open case as in the\nclosed case. For the open spin-1/2 XY chain, we derive the explicit expressions\nof all the charges. For the open spin-1/2 XXX chain, several lowest order\ncharges are presented and a general method of obtaining the boundary terms is\nindicated. In contrast with the closed case, the XXX charges cannot be\ndescribed in terms of a Catalan tree pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 1996 21:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 1996 00:49:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
