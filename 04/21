For a Morse map $f:M\\to\nS^1$ there is a refined version of Novikov complex, defined over the Novikov\ncompletion of the fundamental group ring. We prove that for a $C^0$ generic\n$f$-gradient the corresponding incidence coefficients belong to the image in\nthe Novikov ring of a (non commutative) localization of the fundamental group\nring. The Novikov construction generalizes also to the case of Morse 1-forms.\nIn this case the corresponding incidence coefficients belong to the suitable\ncompletion of the ring of integral Laurent polynomials of several variables. We\nprove that for a given Morse form $\\omega$ and a $C^0$ generic\n$\\omega$-gradient these incidence coefficients are rational functions. The\nincidence coefficients in the Novikov complex are obtained by counting the\nalgebraic number of the trajectories of the gradient, joining the zeros of the\nMorse form. There is V.I.Arnold's version of the exponential growth conjecture,\nwhich concerns the total number of trajectories. We confirm it for any given\nMorse form and a $C^0$ dense set of its gradients. We also give an example of\nexplicit computation of the Novikov complex.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Apr 1996 20:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
