We\nshow that this early formation of giant galaxies gives strong constraints on\nmodels of cosmic structure formation. Adopting the COBE normalization for the\ndensity perturbation spectrum, we argue that the following models do not have\nlarge enough power on galactic scales to yield the observed abundance: (i)\nstandard cold dark matter (CDM) models (where mass density $\\Omega_0=1$ and\npower index $n=1$) with the Hubble constant $h\\lsim 0.35$; (ii) tilted CDM\nmodels with $h=0.5$ and $n\\lsim 0.75$; (iii) open CDM models with $h\\lsim 0.8$\nand $\\Omega_0 \\lsim 0.3$, and (iv) mixed dark matter models with $h=0.5$ and\n$\\Omega _\\nu \\gsim 0.2$. Flat CDM models with a cosmological constant\n$\\lambda_0 \\sim 0.7$ are consistent with the observation, provided that $h\\gsim\n0.6$. Combined with constraints from large-scale structure formation, these\nresults imply that the flat CDM model with a low $\\Omega_0$ is the only one\nthat is fully consistent with observations. We predict that these high-redshift\ngalaxies are more strongly clustered than normal galaxies observed today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Apr 1996 13:22:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
