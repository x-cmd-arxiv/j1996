Employing a theory of polynomials\northogonal with respect to exponential weights we calculate with asymptotic\naccuracy the two-point kernel over all distance scale, and show that in the\nlimit of large dimensions of random matrices the properly rescaled local\neigenvalue correlations are independent of level confinement while global\nsmoothed connected correlations depend on confinement potential only through\nthe endpoints of spectrum. We also obtain exact expressions for density of\nlevels, one- and two-point Green's functions, and prove that new universal\nlocal relationship exists for suitably normalized and rescaled connected\ntwo-point Green's function. Connection between structure of Szeg\\\"o function\nentering strong polynomial asymptotics and mean-field equation is traced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Apr 1996 14:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 1996 10:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
