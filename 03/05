The UV continuum between 1220 and 1990 A has\nvaried considerably. In 1991 August, the flux at 1360 A reached a maximum level\n~27 times as high as its minimum level. At 1850 A, the continuum varies by a\nfactor of ~12. Significant variations are frequently observed in periods as\nshort as one month. The total flux of Ly-alpha and C IV emission varies by a\nfactor of ~5. Their profiles are fitted with one narrow component, unresolved\nat the instrumental resolution of FWHM ~2000 km/s, and three broad components\n(FWHM ~6000 km/s). The narrow component varies by a factor of ~2.5. The broad\ncomponents on the blue and red wings of the Ly-alpha and C IV emission profile,\nwhich correspond to the double humps in the H-alpha and H-beta emission\nfeature, display a close correlation to the varying continuum, with a time lag\nof ~45 days. The blue Ly-alpha component has been stronger than the red\ncomponent except for several epochs in 1980 and 1991. The C IV/Ly-alpha flux\nratio is ~0.4 for the narrow component. For the broad components, this ratio\nvaries considerably around an average value of unity. In 1991 March, the blue\nLy-alpha component was stronger than the red, while for C IV the red component\nwas stronger. Such differential variations do not match the accretion disk\ncharacteristics. The findings suggest that the narrow- and broad-line region in\n3C 390.3 may be associated with a radio jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 1996 16:25:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Expressing the RST action in terms of\nthe ADM formulation, the constraint structure can be analysed completely. It is\nshown that from the view point of local field theories, there exists a hidden\ndynamical field in the RST model. Thanks to the presence of this hidden\ndynamical field, we can reconstruct the closed algebra of the constraints which\nguarantee the general invariance of the RST action. The resulting stress\ntensors are recovered to be true tensor quantities. At the quantum level, the\ncancellation condition for the total central charge is reexamined. Finally,\nwith the help of the hidden dynamical field, the fact that the semi-classical\nstatic solution of the RST model has two independent parameters (P,M), whereas\nfor the classical CGHS model there is only one, can be explained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 Mar 1996 10:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
