We study the $O(4)$ linear sigma model to leading order in a large-$N$\nexpansion. Starting at a temperature above the phase transition, the system\nexpands and cools, finally settling into the broken symmetry vacuum state. We\nconsider the proper time evolution of the effective pion mass, the order\nparameter $\\langle \\sigma \\rangle$, and the particle number distribution. We\nexamine several different initial conditions and look for instabilities\n(exponentially growing long wavelength modes) which can lead to the formation\nof disoriented chiral condensates (DCCs). We find that instabilities exist for\nproper times which are less than 3 fm/c. We also show that an experimental\nsignature of domain growth is an increase in the low momentum spectrum of\noutgoing pions when compared to an expansion in thermal equilibrium. In\ncomparison to particle production during a longitudinal expansion, we find that\nin a spherical expansion the system reaches the ``out'' regime much faster and\nmore particles get produced. However the size of the unstable region, which is\nrelated to the domain size of DCCs, is not enhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 1996 16:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Mar 1996 15:20:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Apr 1996 13:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
