The main feature of our approach is the theoretically sound\ntreatment of collisions.

We also introduce the concept of nonequilibrium dynamical\nscreening. The dephasing of excitonic quantum beats as a result of\ncarrier-carrier scattering is brought out. At low densities it is found that\nthe dephasing times due to carrier-carrier scattering is in picoseconds and not\nfemtoseconds, in agreement with experiments. The polarization dephasing rates\nare computed as a function of the excited carrier density and it is found that\nthe dephasing rate for carrier-carrier scattering is proportional to the\ncarrier density at ultralow densities. The scaling relation is sublinear at\nhigher densities, which enables a comparison with experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 1996 03:04:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Apr 1996 04:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The model is well suited to test the idea that an\nentropy collapse is at the bottom-line of the dynamical singularity encountered\nin structural glasses. The model is studied in three dimensions through Monte\nCarlo simulations, which put in evidence fragile glass behavior with stretched\nexponential relaxation and super-Arrhenius behavior of the relaxation time. Our\ndata are in favor of a Vogel-Fulcher behavior of the relaxation time, related\nto an entropy collapse at the Kauzmann temperature. We however encounter\ndifficulties analogous to those found in experimental systems when\nextrapolating thermodynamical data at low temperatures. We study the spin glass\nsusceptibility investigating the behavior of the correlation length in the\nsystem. We find that the the increase of the relaxation time is not accompanied\nby any growth of the correlation length. We discuss the scaling properties of\noff-equilibrium dynamics in the glassy regime, finding qualitative agreement\nwith the mean-field theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 Mar 1996 12:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
