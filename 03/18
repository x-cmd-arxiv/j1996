Magnetic field reconnection may play a major\nrole in changing the topology of the magnetic field in the central cooling flow\nregions. The effect of the topology change is that cool flux loops can\nreconnect to hot flux loops that are connected to the overall thermal reservoir\nof the cluster. There can be a rapid recycling of mass between hot and cold\nphases on a time scale of 3 x 10^8-10^9 yr which may reduce the inferred inflow\nand mass condensation rates by at least an order of magnitude. A central\nmultiphase medium is a direct consequence of such a model. Throughout the\ncooling flow the filling factor of the hot loops (T > 2 x 10^7 K) is of order\nunity. The filling factor of the cool loops (T < 2 x 10^7 K) is 0.1-1% with a\ncorresponding mass fraction of cold phase of 1-10%. A crucial parameter is the\ncoherence length of the field relative to the cooling radius and the\ndistribution of field energy with scale. When the cooling radius is greater\nthan the field coherence length then cooling flows proceed as usual. When the\ncoherence length is greater than the central cooling radius, however, the\nthermal energy of the reservoir can be tapped and the mass condensation rates\nmay be very significantly reduced. Three additional conditions must be\nsatisfied: I. Cold loops must be able to fall at least as far as the mean\ndistance between hot loops in a cooling time; II. Loops must enter an\nevaporative phase on reconnecting; and III. A sufficient number of hot loops\npenetrate the cold phase region to power the radiative losses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 1996 19:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In the ASCA observation we observed rapid\nvariability with a doubling time scale of 1000 seconds. A spectral variability\nevent was observed in which the spectrum softened and hardened above and below\n~1 keV, respectively, as the flux increased. The spectra could be modeled with\n5 components: a power law, warm absorber, iron K(alpha) line and soft excess\ncomponent flux. The spectral variability resulted from a highly significant\nchange in the intrinsic photon law index from Gamma ~1.6 to ~2.0, an increase\nin the warm absorber ionization, and a marginally significant decrease in the\nsoft component normalization. A ~100 eV equivalent width narrow iron K(alpha)\nline was detected in the high state spectrum. Spectral hardening during flux\nincreases was observed in three ROSAT observations.\n  The change in intrinsic photon index and disappearance of the soft excess\ncomponent in the ASCA spectra can be explained as a transition from a first\norder pair reprocessed spectrum to a pair cascade brought about by a sudden\nincrease in the injected electron Lorentz factor. The change in the ionization\nof the warm absorber, though model dependent, could correspond to the increase\nin flux at the oxygen edges resulting from the spectral index change. The ROSAT\nspectral variability can be interpreted by variable intensity hard power law\nand a relatively nonvarying soft component, possibly primary disk emission.\nThese results are compared with those reported from other narrow-line Seyfert 1\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 Mar 1996 09:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

In a disk\ngalaxy with both a radial color gradient and non-circular motion, isochromes or\niso-color contours should follow the shape of closed stellar orbits, and the\nellipticity of the isophotes should vary as a function of wavelength. A\ndifference in the ellipticity of isochromes and the isophotes can be used to\ndetect the presence of non-circular motion. A model galaxy is constructed which\ndemonstrates this phenomenon. The difference between isochrome and isophote\nellipticity is directly related to the ellipticity of the potential. This\nprovides a new way to measure the ellipticity of the dark matter in the outer\nparts of galaxies.\n  As an example, we apply this technique to two dwarf galaxies NGC 1800 and NGC\n7764.
