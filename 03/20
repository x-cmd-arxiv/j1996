In the same energy range the\nbulk of the supersymmetric Higgs corrections to the TGV's is due to the\nlightest neutral Higgs, h_0, whose contribution is like that of a Standard\nModel Higgs of the same mass. The contributions of the Neutralinos and\nCharginos are sensitive to the input value for the soft gaugino mass M_{1/2},\nbeing more pronounced for values M_{1/2} < 100 GeV. In this case and in the\nunphysical region, 0 < \\sqrt{s} < 2 M_W , their contributions are substantially\nenhanced resulting in large corrections to the static quantities of the W\nboson. However, such an enhancement is not observed in the physical region. In\ngeneral for 2 M_W < \\sqrt{s} < 200 GeV the MSSM predictions differ from those\nof the SM but they are of the same order of magnitude. To be detectable\ndeviations from the SM require sensitivities reaching the per mille level and\nhence unlikely to be observed at LEP200. For higher energies SM and MSSM\npredictions exhibit a fast fall off behaviour, in accord with unitarity\nrequirements, getting smaller,in most cases, by almost an order of magnitude\nalready at energies \\sqrt{s} 0.5 TeV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 Mar 1996 14:17:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
