In these models, the calculation of consistent gauge anomalies usually\nfound in the literature as a solution to the Zumino-Stora descent equations is\nreconsidered. Another solution of the descent equations that differs on the\nterms involving mixed gauge anomalies is presented on this paper. The origin of\ntheir difference is analysed, and using Fujikawa's formalism the second result\nis argued to be the divergence of the usual chiral current. Invoking\ntopological arguments the physical equivalence of both solutions is explained,\nbut only the second one can be technically called the consistent anomaly of a\nclassically invariant theory. The first one corresponds to the addition of\nnoninvariant local counterterms to the action. A consistency check of their\nphysical equivalence is performed by implementing the four dimensional string\ninspired Green-Schwarz mechanism for both expressions. This is achieved adding\nslightly different anomaly cancelling terms to the original action, whose\ndifference is precisely the local counterterms mentioned before. The complete\nanomaly free action is therefore uniquely defined, and the resulting\nconstraints on the spectrum of fermion charges are the same. The Lorentz\ninvariance of the fermion measure in four dimensions forces the Lorentz\nvariation of the Green-Schwarz terms to cancel by itself, producing an\nadditional constraint usually overlooked in the literature. This often happens\nwhen a dual description of the theory is used without including all local\ncounterterms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Feb 1996 23:26:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper we investigate how\nalternatives extended over time reduce to the usual instantaneous alternatives\nin a simple model in non-relativistic quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show\nhow the decoherence of a particular set of spacetime alternatives becomes\nautomatic as the time over which they extend approaches zero and estimate how\nlarge this time can be before the interference between the alternatives becomes\nnon-negligible. These results suggest that the time scale over which coarse\ngrainings of such quantities as the center of mass position of a massive body\nmay be extended in time before producing significant interference is much\nlonger than characteristic dynamical time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Feb 1996 22:10:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
