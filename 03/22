The function parametrizing the hypersurfaces can\nbe interpreted as the phase of a light wave uniformly emitted by some far-away\nstatic observer. The definition gives back the accepted value of surface\ngravity in the static case by virtue of its nonlocal character. Although the\ndefinition is motivated by the behavior of outgoing null rays, it turns out\nthat there is a simple connection between the generalized surface gravity, the\nacceleration of any radially moving observer, and the observed frequency change\nof the infalling light signal. In particular, this gives a practical and simple\nmethod of how any geodesic observer can determine surface gravity by measuring\nonly the redshift of the infalling light wave. The surface gravity can be\nexpressed as an integral of matter field quantities along an ingoing null line,\nwhich shows that it is a continuous function along the apparent horizon.

They provide new insights and simple\nexplanations of the structure and electromagnetic form factors of the deuteron,\nthe quasi-deuteron model, and the $dp$, $dd$ and $\\alpha d$ $L$=2 ($D$-wave)\ncomponents in $^3$He, $^4$He and $^6$Li. The toroidal distribution has a\nmaximum-density diameter of $\\sim$1 fm and a half-maximum density thickness of\n$\\sim$0.9 fm. Many realistic models of nuclear forces predict these values,\nwhich are supported by the observed electromagnetic form factors of the\ndeuteron, and also predicted by classical Skyrme effective Lagrangians, related\nto QCD in the limit of infinite colors. Due to the rather small size of this\nstructure, it could have a revealing relation to certain aspects of QCD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 Mar 1996 19:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

The element $x$ of the ring over which the TQFT is defined does not\nhave to be invertible. In particular, it may be 0. This modification makes it\npossible to extend quantum-invariants, which vanish on $S^1\\times S^2$, to\nnon-trivial TQFT's. (A TQFT in the sense of Atiyah with this property has to be\ntrivial all together). Under a few natural assumptions the notion of a\nhalf-projective TQFT is shown to be the only possible generalization. Based on\nseparate work with Lyubashenko on connected TQFT's, we construct a large class\nof half-projective TQFT's with $x=0$. Their invariants vanish on $S^1\\times\nS^2$, and they coincide with the Hennings invariant for non-semisimple Hopf\nalgebras. Several toplogical tools that are relevant for vanishing properties\nof such TQFT's are developed. They are concerned with connectivity properties\nof cobordisms, as for example maximal non-separating surfaces. We introduce in\nparticular the notions of ``interior'' homotopy and homology groups, and of\ncoordinate graphs, which are functions on cobordisms with values in the\nmorphisms of a graph category. For applications we will prove that\nhalf-projective TQFT's with $x=0$ vanish on cobordisms with infinite interior\nhomology, and we argue that the order of divergence of the TQFT on a cobordism\nin the ``classical limit'' can be estimated by the rank of its maximal free\ninterior group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 1996 02:44:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
