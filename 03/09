H_2 self-\nshielding is discussed, including the effects of line overlap. We find that\nline overlap is important for N(H_2) > 10^{20} cm^{-2}. We compute multiline UV\npumping models, and compare these with simple analytic approximations for the\neffects of self-shielding.\n  The overall fluorescent efficiency of the photodissociation front is obtained\nfor different ratios of chi/n_H (where chi characterizes the intensity of the\nincident UV) and different dust extinction laws. The dust optical depth\ntau_{pdr} to the point where 50% of the H is molecular is found to be a simple\nfunction of a dimensionless quantity phi_0 depending on chi/n_H, the rate\ncoefficient for H_2 formation on grains, and the UV dust opacity. The\nfluorescent efficiency of the PDR also depends primarily on phi_0 for chi<3000\nand n_H<10^4 cm^{-3}; for stronger radiation fields and higher densities\nradiative and collisional depopulation of vibrationally-excited levels\ninterferes with the radiative cascade. The emission spectrum from the PDR is\nessentially independent of the color temperature $T_{color}$ of the incident UV\nfor T_{color}>10^4K, but shows some sensitivity to the v-J distribution of\nnewly-formed H_2. The 1-0S(1)/2-1S(1) and 2-1S(1)/6-4Q(1) intensity ratios, the\northo/para ratio, and the rotational temperature in the $v$=1 and $v$=2 levels\nare computed as functions of the temperature and density, for different values\nof chi and n_H.\n  We apply our models to the reflection nebula NGC 2023. We are best able to\nreproduce the observations with models having chi=5000, n_H=10^5 cm^{-3}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 1996 19:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In this approach the temperature anisotropy is written as a\ntime integral over the product of a geometrical term and a source term. The\ngeometrical term is given by radial eigenfunctions which do not depend on the\nparticular cosmological model. The source term can be expressed in terms of\nphoton, baryon and metric perturbations, all of which can be calculated using a\nsmall number of differential equations. This split clearly separates between\nthe dynamical and geometrical effects on the CMB anisotropies. More\nimportantly, it allows to significantly reduce the computational time compared\nto standard methods. This is achieved because the source term, which depends on\nthe model and is generally the most time consuming part of calculation, is a\nslowly varying function of wavelength and needs to be evaluated only in a small\nnumber of points. The geometrical term, which oscillates much more rapidly than\nthe source term, does not depend on the particular model and can be precomputed\nin advance. Standard methods that do not separate the two terms and require a\nmuch higher number of evaluations. The new method leads to about two orders of\nmagnitude reduction in CPU time when compared to standard methods and typically\nrequires a few minutes on a workstation for a single model. The method should\nbe especially useful for accurate determinations of cosmological parameters\nfrom CMB anisotropy and polarization measurements that will become possible\nwith the next generation of experiments.

The first\nand more straightforward approach is to fit a single ``best'' model to the\noriginal data, and then to generate surrogate data sets that are ``typical\nrealizations'' of that model. The second approach concentrates not on the model\nbut directly on the original data; it attempts to constrain the surrogate data\nsets so that they exactly agree with the original data for a specified set of\nsample statistics. Examples of these two approaches are provided for two simple\ncases: a test for deviations from a gaussian distribution, and a test for\nserial dependence in a time series. Additionally, we consider tests for\nnonlinearity in time series based on a Fourier transform (FT) method and on\nmore conventional autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) fits to the data. The\ncomparative performance of hypothesis testing schemes based on these two\napproaches is found to depend on whether or not the discriminating statistic is\npivotal. A statistic is ``pivotal'' if its distribution is the same for all\nprocesses consistent with the null hypothesis. The typical-realization method\nrequires that the discriminating statistic satisfy this property. The\nconstrained-realization approach, on the other hand, does not share this\nrequirement, and can provide an accurate and powerful test without having to\nsacrifice flexibility in the choice of discriminating statistic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 Mar 1996 17:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
