We emphasize the theoretical and experimental advantages of the\nobservable $R_{b+c}\\equiv \\Gamma(Z\\to b\\bar b\\mbox{ or } c\\bar\nc)/\\Gamma(Z\\to\\mbox{hadrons})$. We also stress the role of $R_\\ell\\equiv\n\\Gamma(Z\\to\\mbox{hadrons})/\\Gamma(Z\\to \\ell^+\\ell^-)$ in testing the Standard\nModel (SM) despite its dependence on QCD corrections. Noting that in models\nwith FCNC the amplitude for $Z\\to c\\bar c$ receives a contribution which grows\nwith $m^2_t$, the importance and uniqueness of precision $Z\\to c\\bar c$\nmeasurements for constraining flavor changing $t\\bar c$ currents is\nunderscored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 Mar 1996 23:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}

Point sets can be\ncharacterized by their discrepancy, which is a measure of its non-uniformity.\nPoint sets with a discrepancy that is low with respect to the expected value\nfor truly random point sets, are generally thought to be desirable. A low value\nof the discrepancy implies a negative correlation between the points, which may\nbe usefully employed to improve the error estimate of a numerical integral\nbased on the point set.
