These theorems demonstrate the breakdown of\nthe theory at certain `base points' of the Cauchy horizon, which are defined as\n`past terminal accumulation points' of the horizon generators.

Specifically, we prove: Theorem 1: There is no\nextension to (M,g_{ab}) of the usual field algebra on the initial globally\nhyperbolic region which satisfies the condition of F-locality at any base\npoint. In other words, any extension of the field algebra must, in any globally\nhyperbolic neighbourhood of any base point, differ from the algebra one would\ndefine on that neighbourhood according to the rules for globally hyperbolic\nspacetimes. Theorem 2: The two-point distribution for any Hadamard state\ndefined on the initial globally hyperbolic region must (when extended to a\ndistributional bisolution of the covariant Klein-Gordon equation on the full\nspacetime) be singular at every base point x in the sense that the difference\nbetween this two point distribution and a local Hadamard distribution cannot be\ngiven by a bounded function in any neighbourhood (in MXM) of (x,x). Theorem 2\nimplies quantities such as the renormalized expectation value of \\phi^2 or of\nthe stress-energy tensor are necessarily ill-defined or singular at any base\npoint.

Hence they lead to\na prediction for proton lifetime in agreement with the experimental lower\nlimit. This paper reviews the recent work on the tree-level potential and the\none-loop effective potential for such models, with application to inflationary\ncosmology. The open problems are the use of the most general form of tree-level\npotential for $SO(10)$ models in the reheating stage of the early universe, and\nthe analysis of non-local effects in the semiclassical field equations for such\nmodels in Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 Mar 1996 09:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The $q$-deformed\nVirasoro algebra possesses an additional index $\\alpha$, which is directly\nrelated to point-splitting of the currents. The generators in the $q$-deformed\ncase are found to exactly reproduce the results obtained by probing the fields\n$X(z)$ (string coordinate) and $\\Phi (z)$ (string momentum) with the\nnon-splitted Virasoro generators and lead to a particular representation of the\n$SU_q (1,1)$ algebra characterized by the standard conformal dimension $J$ of\nthe field.

As a consequence,\nzeros of the Higgs field exist (called anti-zeros) around which the local\nwinding number has opposite sign to that of the total winding.
