We derive a\nset of coupled integral equations, the parquet equations, governing the\nstructure factor of the two-dimensional vortex liquid system with and without\nrandom impurities and the three-dimensional system in the absence of disorder.\nFor the pure two-dimensional system, we simplify the parquet equations\nconsiderably and obtain one simple equation for the structure factor. In two\ndimensions, we solve the parquet equations numerically and find growing\ntranslational order characterized by a length scale $R_c$ as the temperature is\nlowered. The temperature dependence of $R_c$ is obtained in both pure and\nweakly disordered cases. The effect of disorder appears as a smooth decrease of\n$R_c$ as the strength of disorder increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 Mar 1996 17:30:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

This simple Ansatz has proved extremely\nfruitful in the development of the foundations of quantum mechanics. While the\nensuing type of models has often been argued to be rather artificial, recent\nadvances in quantum optics have demonstrated their prinicpal and practical\nfeasibility. A brief historical review of the standard model together with an\noutline of its virtues and limitations are presented as an illustration of the\nmutual inspiration that has always taken place between foundational and\nexperimental research in quantum physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 1996 13:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
