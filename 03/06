We explore the dynamics of resonant relaxation using both\nnumerical simulations and order-of-magnitude analytic calculations. We find\nthat the resonant angular momentum relaxation time is shorter than the\nnon-resonant relaxation time by of order $M_\\star/M$, where $M_\\star$ is the\nmass in stars and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Resonance does not\nenhance the energy relaxation rate.

We show that relativistic precession can disable resonant\nrelaxation near the main-sequence loss cone for black hole masses comparable to\nthose in galactic nuclei. Resonant dynamical friction leads to growth or decay\nof the eccentricity of the orbit of a massive body, depending on whether the\ndistribution function of the stars is predominantly radial or tangential.

We\nwork with two chiral models, the linear sigma model and the non-linear one. For\nthe last one we use two versions, one which does not satisfy PCAC, and another\none which does. We show that the quark condensate, as other observables, is\nindependent on the variant selected. The application to physical pions excludes\nthe linear sigma model as a credible one. In the non-linear models our\nconclusions are: first there is no systematic reaction imposed by chiral\nsymmetry against symmetry restoration, second, if one keeps only the s-wave\npion-nucleon interaction, the quark condensate evolves essentially linearly\nwith density, as if the nucleons were non interacting. The main correction\narises from the p-wave pion-nucleon interaction. Last, in the s-wave optical\npotential, chiral symmetry tolerates but does not impose two body terms. On the\nother hand the effect of correlations linked to the isospin symmetric amplitude\nis negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 1996 14:49:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 1996 09:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The\nPoisson structure is connected with the transition probabilities through\nunitarity (in a specific formulation intrinsic to the given context).\n  In classical mechanics, where $p(\\rho,\\sigma)=\\dl_{\\rho\\sigma}$, unitarity\n  poses no restriction on the Poisson structure. Quantum mechanics is\ncharacterized by a specific (complex Hilbert space) form of $p$, and by the\nproperty that the irreducible components of $P$ as a transition probability\nspace coincide with the symplectic leaves of $P$ as a Poisson space.
