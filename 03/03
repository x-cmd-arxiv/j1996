We consider Bloch oscillations and\nWannier-Stark localization caused by dc fields, and compare these effects to\ndynamic localization that occurs in the presence of additional ac fields. Our\nanalysis relies on quasienergy eigenstates, which take over the role of the\nusual Bloch waves. The widths of the quasienergy bands depend non-monotonically\non the field parameters. If there is lattice disorder, the degree of the\nresulting Anderson localization is determined by the ratio of disorder strength\nand quasienergy band width. Therefore, the localization lengths can be\ncontrolled, within wide ranges, by adjusting the ac amplitude. Experimental\nrealizations of our model systems are given by semiconductor superlattices in\nfar-infrared laser fields, or by ultracold atoms in modulated standing light\nwaves. In both cases the system parameters, as well as the field amplitudes and\nfrequencies, are readily accessible to experimental control, suggesting these\nas highly attractive candidates for systematic study of localization phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 1996 20:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
