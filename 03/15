In the spin-$1 \\over 2$ chain, the system is gapless for $\\delta=0$\nand $J_2 < J_{2c} =0.241$, and is gapped everywhere else in the $J_2 - \\delta$\nplane. At $J_{2c}$, for small $\\delta$, the gap increases as $\\delta^{\\alpha}$,\nwhere $\\alpha = 0.667 \\pm 0.001$. $2J_2 + \\delta = 1$ is a disorder line. To\nthe left of this line, the structure factor $S(q)$ peaks at $q_{max} = \\pi$\n(Neel `phase'), while to the right, $q_{max}$ decreases from $\\pi$ to $\\pi/2$\n(spiral `phase') as $J_2$ increases. There is also a `$\\uparrow \\uparrow\n\\downarrow \\downarrow$ phase' for large values of both $J_2$ and $\\delta$. In\nthe spin-$1$ case, we find a line running from a gapless point at $(J_2 ,\n\\delta) = (0,0.25 \\pm 0.01)$ upto a `gapless' point at $(0.73 \\pm 0.005,0)$\nsuch that the open chain ground state is four-fold degenerate below the line\nand is unique above it. There is a disorder line in this case also and it has\nthe same equation as in the spin-$1 \\over 2$ case, but the line ends at about\n$\\delta =0.136$. Similar to the spin-$1 \\over 2$ case, to the left of this\nline, the peak in the structure factor is at $\\pi$ (Neel `phase'), while to the\nright of the line, it is at less than $\\pi$ (spiral `phase'). For $\\delta =1$,\nthe system corresponds to a spin ladder and the system is gapped for all values\nof the interchain coupling for both spin-$1 \\over 2$ and spin-$1$ ladders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 1996 07:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Explicitly, we construct (a) natural cocycles of the Torelli group\n(with coefficients in a space of trivalent graphs) and cohomology classes of\nthe abelianized Torelli group; (b) group homomorphisms that detect (rationally)\nthe nontriviality of the lower central series of the Torelli group. Our results\nare motivated by the appearance of trivalent graphs in topology and in\nrepresentation theory and the dual role played by the Casson invariant in the\ntheory of finite type invariants of integral homology 3-spheres and in Morita's\nstudy of the structure of the Torelli group Our results generalize those of S.\nMorita {Mo1,Mo2} and complement the recent calculation, due to R. Hain, of the\nI-adic completion of the rational group ring of the Torelli group. We also give\nanalogous results for two other subgroups of the mapping class group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 1996 16:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 May 1997 14:27:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We consider a solution to this\nproblem based on the spectral decomposition of the particle's (Heisenberg)\nstate into the eigenstates of a suitable operator, which we denote as the\n``time-of-arrival'' operator. We discuss the general properties of this\noperator. We construct the operator explicitly in the simple case of a free\nnonrelativistic particle, and compare the probabilities it yields with the ones\nestimated indirectly in terms of the flux of the Schr\\\"odinger current. We\nderive a well defined uncertainty relation between time-of-arrival and energy;\nthis result shows that the well known arguments against the existence of such a\nrelation can be circumvented. Finally, we define a ``time-representation'' of\nthe quantum mechanics of a free particle, in which the time-of-arrival is\ndiagonal. Our results suggest that, contrary to what is commonly assumed,\nquantum mechanics exhibits a hidden equivalence between independent (time) and\ndependent (position) variables, analogous to the one revealed by the\nparametrized formalism in classical mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 Mar 1996 16:16:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
