The velocity distribution of the barred spirals in the Virgo\nregion is clearly different than that of the nonbarred spirals, suggesting that\nbarred spirals are more common in the main condensation of the cluster. A\nsample cleansed of galaxies not belonging to the main cluster condensation\nusing the subcluster assignments of Binggeli et al. [A&AS, 98, 275 (1993)]\nbears this out, showing that the radial distribution of barred spirals is more\ncentrally condensed than that of nonbarred spirals. In contrast to the spiral\ngalaxies, the distribution of barred S0 galaxies is statistically\nindistinguishable from that of nonbarred S0's. Consideration of the level of\ntidal perturbation due to the cluster mass distribution as compared to that due\nto individual galaxies suggests that tidal triggering by the cluster mass\ndistribution is the most likely source of the enhanced fraction of barred\nspirals in the cluster center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 1996 16:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

All of the 76 LEP-2 allowed fermionic final state processes\nevaluated at tree level are included in version 1.0. grc4f addresses event\nsimulation requirements at e+e- colliders such as LEP and up-coming linear\ncolliders. Most of the attractive aspects of grc4f come from its link to the\nGRACE system: a Feynman diagram automatic computation system. The GRACE system\nhas been used to produce the computational code for all final states, giving a\nhigher level of confidence in the calculation correctness. Based on the\nhelicity amplitude calculation technique, all fermion masses can be kept finite\nand helicity information can be propagated down to the final state particles.\nThe phase space integration of the matrix element gives the total and\ndifferential cross sections, then unweighted events are Generated. Initial\nstate radiation (ISR) corrections are implemented in two ways, one is based on\nthe electron structure function formalism and the second uses the parton shower\nalgorithm called QEDPS. The latter can also be applied for final state\nradiation (FSR) though the interference with the ISR is not yet taken into\naccount. Parton shower and hadronization of the final quarks are performed\nthrough an interface to JETSET. Coulomb correction between two intermediate\nW's, anomalous coupling as well as gluon contributions in the hadronic\nprocesses are also included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 Mar 1996 07:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

We discuss the novel features of neutrino-exchange forces\nwhich lead to large many-body effects, and present the formalism that allows\nthese effects to be calculated explicitly in the Standard Model. After\nconsidering, and excluding, several possibilities for avoiding the unphysically\nlarge contributions from the exchange of massless neutrinos, we develop a\nformalism to describe the exchange of massive neutrinos. It is shown that the\nstability of both neutrons stars and white dwarfs in the presence of many-body\nneutrino-exchange forces implies a lower bound, $m \\gtrsim 0.4$ eV/$c^{2}$ on\nthe mass $m$ of any neutrino.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 Mar 1996 16:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
