In this paper we apply it to topological gravity in\ndimension $n \\geq 3$. Our choice of the gauge condition for conformal\ninvariance is $R+{\\alpha}=0$ , where $R$ is the Ricci scalar curvature. We find\nwhen $\\alpha \\neq 0$, topological symmetry is not broken, but when $\\alpha =0$\nand solutions of the Einstein equations exist then topological symmetry is\nbroken. This conditions connect to the Yamabe conjecture. Namely negative\nconstant scalar curvature exist on manifolds of any topology, but existence of\nnonnegative constant scalar curvature is restricted by topology. This fact is\neasily seen in this theory. Topological symmetry breaking means that BRS\nsymmetry breaking in cohomological field theory. But it is found that another\nBRS symmetry can be defined and physical states are redefined. The divergence\ndue to the Gribov zero modes is regularized, and the theory after topological\nsymmetry breaking become semiclassical Einstein gravitational theory under a\nspecial definition of observables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 1996 05:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

If the depth of the potential is greater than $\\mu^2$,\nthen there exist imaginary frequency modes. It is possible to quantize this\nsimple system, but the mode operators for imaginary frequencies satisfy unusual\ncommutation relations and do not admit a Fock-like representation or a ground\nstate.

We are\ninterested in the field dynamics in the physical case where the initial state\nof the quantum field is specified before the complex frequency modes develop.\nAs a model for this, we investigated a free scalar field whose ``mass\" is\nnormal in the past and becomes ``tachyonic\" in the future. A particle detector\nin the far future placed in the in-vacuum state shows non-vanishing excitations\nrelated to the imaginary frequency modes as well.
