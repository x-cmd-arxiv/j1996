Our sample\nconsists of nine massive halos from an EdS universe with scale free power\nspectrum and n = -1. Halos are resolved by ~20000 particles each, with a\ndynamical resolution of 20-25 kpc. Large scale tidal fields are included up to\nL=150 Mpc using background particles. The halo formation process can be\ncharacterized by the alternation of two dynamical configurations: a merging\nphase and a relaxation phase, defined by their signature on the evolution of\nthe total mass and rms velocity. Halos spend on average one 1/3 of their\nevolution in the merging phase and 2/3 in the relaxation phase. Using this\ndefinition, we study the density profiles and their change during the halo\nhistory. The average density profiles are fitted by the NFW analytical model\nwith an rms residual of 17% between the virial radius Rv and 0.01 Rv. The\nHernquist (1990) profiles fits the same halos with an rms residual of 26%. The\ntrend with mass of the scale radius of these fits is marginally consistent with\nthat found by Cole & Lacey (1996): in comparison our halos are more centrally\nconcentrated, and the relation between scale radius and halo mass is slightly\nsteeper. We find a moderately large scatter in this relation, due both to\ndynamical evolution within halos and to fluctuations in the halo population. We\nanalyze the dynamical equilibrium of our halos using the Jeans' equation, and\nfind that on average they are approximately in equilibrium within their virial\nradius. Finally, we find that the projected mass profiles of our simulated\nhalos are in very good agreement with the profiles of three rich galaxy\nclusters derived from strong and weak gravitational lensing observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 Mar 1996 18:48:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Jun 1997 14:38:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The Breit equation is known to be\npathological when singularities appear at finite separations $r$ in the reduced\nset of coupled equations for attractive potentials even when the potentials\nthemselves are not singular there.

The Lagrangian includes all the\npossible world--line first order invariants of the manifold. Each combination\nof the four constant parameters entering the Lagrangian gives the model, which\ndescribes the proper irreducible Poincar\\'e dynamics both at the classical and\nquantum levels, and thereby the construction uniformly embodies the massive,\nmassless and continuous helicity cases depending upon the special choice of the\nparameters. For the massive case, the connection with the Souriau approach to\nelementary systems is established. Constrained Hamiltonian formulation is built\nand Dirac canonical quantization is performed for the model in the covariant\nform. An explicit realization is given for the physical wave functions in terms\nof smooth tensor fields on ${\\bf R}^{3,1}\\times S^2$. One-parametric family of\nconsistent interactions with general electromagnetic and gravitational fields\nis introduced in the massive case. The spin tensor is shown to satisfy the\nFrenkel-Nyborg equation with arbitrary fixed gyromagnetic ratio in a limit of\nweakly varying electromagnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 Mar 1996 15:51:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
