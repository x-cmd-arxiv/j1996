If this is\nthe case, then the outbursts should also dominate the accretion of angular\nmomentum. During the outbursts, the accretion rate is so high that the magnetic\nfield of the star should not disrupt the disk, and the disk will extend all the\nway in to the stellar surface. Standard thin disk models then predict that the\nstar should accrete large amounts of angular momentum, which will produce a\nsecular spinup of the star. We present boundary layer solutions for FU Orionis\nparameters which show that the angular momentum accretion rate drops below zero\nfor stellar rotation rates which are always substantially below breakup, but\ndepend on the mass accretion rate and on the adopted definition of the stellar\nradius. When the angular momentum accretion rate drops close to zero, the star\nwill stop spinning up. Faster stellar rotation rates will produce negative\nangular momentum accretion which will spin the star down. Therefore, FU Orionis\noutbursts can keep the stellar rotation rate close to some equilibrium value\nfor which the angular momentum accretion rate is small. We show that this\nequilibrium rotation rate may be similar to the observed rotation rates of T\nTauri stars; thus we propose that FU Orionis outbursts may be responsible for\nthe observed slow rotation of T Tauri stars.

The principal ingredient of\nthe calculation is resummation of the universal leading-logarithm effects of\ngluon radiation to all orders in the quantum chromodynamics coupling strength,\nrestricted to the region of phase space that is demonstrably perturbative. We\nderive the perturbative regime of the resummed series, starting from the\nprincipal-value resummation approach, and we isolate the perturbative domain in\nboth moment space and, upon inversion of the corresponding Mellin transform, in\nmomentum space. We show that our perturbative result does not depend on the\nmanner non-perturbative or infrared effects are handled in principal-value\nresummation. We treat both the quark-antiquark and gluon-gluon production\nchannels consistently in the $\\overline{{\\rm MS}}$ factorization scheme. We\ncompare our method and results with other resummation methods that rely on the\nchoice of infrared cutoffs. We derive the renormalization/factorization scale\ndependence of our resummed cross section, and we discuss factorization scheme\ndependence and remaining theoretical uncertainties, including estimates of\npossible non-perturbative contributions. We include the full content of the\nexact next-to-leading order calculation in obtaining our final results.

Due to the presence of conical\nsingularities, it is shown that the relation between the zeta-function and the\nheat kernel is non trivial and, as first pointed out by Cheeger, requires a\nseparation between small and large eigenvalues of the Laplace operator. As a\nconsequence, in the massless case, the (naive) non existence of the Mellin\ntransform is by-passed by the Cheeger's analytical continuation of the\nzeta-function on manifold with conical singularities. Furthermore, the\ncontinuous spectrum leads to the introduction of smeared traces. In general, it\nis pointed out that the presence of the divergences may depend on the smearing\nfunction and they arise in removing the smearing cutoff. With a simple choice\nof the smearing function, horizon divergences in the thermodynamical quantities\nare recovered and these are similar to the divergences found by means of\noff-shell methods like the brick wall model, the optical conformal\ntransformation techniques or the canonical path integral method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 Mar 1996 16:28:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 May 1996 11:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
