Using Zimmerman's normal products and the BPHZ renormalisation\nmethod, we obtain a corresponding local quantum operator equation, which is\nvalid to all orders in perturbation theory. The formulation implies a\ncalculational method for anomalies to all orders that is useful also outside\nthe BV context and that remains completely within regularised perturbation\ntheory. It makes no difference in principle whether the anomaly appears at one\nloop or at higher loops. The method is illustrated by computing the one- and\ntwo-loop anomalies in chiral $W_3$ gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 1996 14:55:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Jun 1996 09:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

In the present paper the power of density functional theory calculations\nis demonstrated by investigations for two different adsorption systems, namely,\none with a strongly electropositive adsorbate [Na on Al(111)] and one with a\nstrongly electronegative adsorbate [O on Ru(0001)]. In each case, new hitherto\nnot expected adsorbate phases have been predicted by the theory: For Na on\nAl(111) the stability of a \"four-layer\" surface alloy was identified while for\nO on Ru(0001) it was predicted that the formation of a (1 x 1)-O adlayer should\nbe possible which implies that the apparent saturation coverage of 1/2 is due\nto kinetic hindering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 Mar 1996 11:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
