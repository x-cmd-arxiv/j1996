A correlation is found\nbetween ax and aox; similar correlations have recently been reported in other\nX-ray and optical samples. We also identify previously unreported relationships\nbetween the optical slope (aopt) and ax (particularly at high redshifts) and\nbetween aopt and aox.

The exclusive semileptonic modes B\n-> D l \\nu and B -> D* l \\nu are described through the universal Isgur-Wise\nform factor, which is calculated in terms of a constituent quark model wave\nfunction for the B-meson. Different approximations for the latter, either based\non a phenomenological ansatz or derived from analyses of the meson spectra, are\nadopted. In particular, two wave functions, constructed via the Hamiltonian\nlight-front formalism using a relativized and a non-relativistic constituent\nquark model, are considered, obtaining a link between standard spectroscopic\nquark models and the B-meson decay physics. The inclusive semileptonic and\nnon-leptonic branching ratios are calculated within a convolution approach,\ninspired by the partonic model and involving the same B-meson wave function\nused for the evaluation of the exclusive semileptonic modes. Our results for\nthe major branching ratios are consistent with available experimental data and\nthe sum of all the calculated branching ratios turns out to be close to unity.\nIn particular, we found that: i) a remarkable fraction (~ 35%) of semileptonic\ndecay modes occur in non-D, non-D* final states; ii) non-perturbative effects\nenhance the inclusive b -> c \\bar{u} d decay channels, with a sizable\ncontribution provided by internal decays into heavy mesons and\nbaryon-antibaryon pairs; the resulting reduction of the semileptonic branching\nratio brings the theoretical prediction in agreement with the experimental\nvalue without increasing at the same time the charm counting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 Mar 1996 17:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Jun 1997 06:43:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Oct 1997 10:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
