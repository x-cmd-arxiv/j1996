The\nsample observed consists of 11 flat-spectrum radio sources known to have red\noptical to infra-red colours plus two steep-spectrum narrow-line radio\ngalaxies. Spectra of the sources were obtained in the 3-, 2- and 1.3-millimetre\nbands at frequencies corresponding to common molecular transitions of CO, HCO+,\nHCN and CS at the AGN redshift. No absorptions were detected in any of the\nsources. We calculated upper limits to the column density in molecular\nabsorption, using an excitation temperature of 10 K, to be N(CO) < 10^{15} -\n10^{16} cm^-2, equivalent to hydrogen columns of order N(H) < 10^{19} - 10^{20}\ncm^-2.\n  These limits are significantly lower than the values N(H) \\approx (2 - 6)\n10^{21} cm^-2 that might be expected if the red colours of these sources were\ndue to dust absorption at the quasar redshift as suggested by Webster et al.\n(1995). Should the excitation temperature of the molecular transitions be\nhigher than 100K, the upper limits to the H2 column densities would be greater\nthan those derived from the red colours. To explain the lack of molecular\nabsorption we conclude that either the optical extinction takes place outside\nthe host galaxy (along the line of sight), or the excitation temperature of the\nmolecular transitions is very high, or the obscuration is not associated with\nsignificant amounts of cold molecular gas. It is quite possible that the hard\nX-ray flux from the central source of these AGN is strong enough to\nphoto-dissociate the molecules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 Mar 1996 17:12:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

These inequalities involve the scaling exponents of\nthe velocity structure functions and, in a refined form, an intermittency\nexponent of the convective-range scalar flux. They are valid for 3D\nNavier-Stokes turbulence and satisfied within errors by present experimental\ndata. The inequalities also hold for any ``synthetic'' turbulent velocity\nstatistics with a finite correlation in time. We show that for time-correlation\nexponents of the velocity smaller than the ``local turnover'' exponent, the\nscalar spectral exponent is strictly less than that in Kraichnan's soluble\n``rapid-change'' model with velocity delta-correlated in time. Our results\ninclude as a special case an exponent-inequality derived previously by\nConstantin \\& Procaccia [Nonlinearity {\\bf 7} 1045 (1994)], but with a more\ndirect proof. The inequalities in their simplest form follow from a\nKolmogorov-type relation for the turbulent passive scalar valid in each space\ndimension $d.$ Our improved inequalities are based upon a rigorous version of\nthe refined similarity hypothesis for passive scalars. These are compared with\nthe relations implied by ``fusion rules'' hypothesized for scalar gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 Mar 1996 15:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
