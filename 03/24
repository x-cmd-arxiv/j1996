A requirement that there must be a minimum in\nthe action as a function of its width provides a maximum velocity. The velocity\ndependence of the width and energy can be determined. The motions of a soliton\nin p olyacetylene and an acoustic polaron in polydiacetylene are studied within\nthis formulation.
