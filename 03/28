In all cases, the thermal effects for an entropy per\nbaryon of order 2 or less are small when considering the maximum neutron star\nmass. Neutrino trapping, however, significantly changes the maximum mass due to\nthe abundance of electrons. When matter is allowed to contain only nucleons and\nleptons, trapping decreases the maximum mass by an amount comparable to, but\nsomewhat larger than, the increase due to finite entropy. When matter is\nallowed to contain strongly interacting negatively charged particles, in the\nform of strange baryons, a kaon condensate, or quarks, trapping instead results\nin an increase in the maximum mass of order $0.2M_\\odot$, which adds to the\neffects of finite entropy. The presence of negatively-charged particles has two\nmajor implications. First, the value of the maximum mass will decrease during\nthe early evolution of a neutron star as it loses trapped neutrinos, so that if\na black hole forms, it either does so immediately after the bounce or it is\ndelayed for a neutrino diffusion timescale of $\\sim 10$ s.

Second, the appearance of hadronic negative charges\nresults in a general softening of the equation of state that may be observable\nin the neutrino luminosities and average energies.
