The covariant notion of a kinematic self-similarity in the context\nof relativistic fluid mechanics is defined. Various mathematical and physical\nproperties of spacetimes admitting a kinematic self-similarity are discussed.\nThe governing equations for perfect fluid cosmological models are introduced\nand a set of integrability conditions for the existence of a proper kinematic\nself-similarity in these models is derived. Exact solutions of the irrotational\nperfect fluid Einstein field equations admitting a kinematic self-similarity\nare then sought in a number of special cases, and it is found that; (1) in the\ngeodesic case the 3-spaces orthogonal to the fluid velocity vector are\nnecessarily Ricci-flat and (ii) in the further specialisation to dust the\ndifferential equation governing the expansion can be completely integrated and\nthe asymptotic properties of these solutions can be determined, (iii) the\nsolutions in the case of zero-expansion consist of a class of shear-free and\nstatic models and a class of stiff perfect fluid (and non-static) models, and\n(iv) solutions in which the kinematic self-similar vector is parallel to the\nfluid velocity vector are necessarily Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 1996 20:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
