We consider a scenario where Lorentz\ninvariance is only an approximate property of equations of matter above a\ncertain distance scale, and superluminal sectors of matter exist related to new\ndegrees of freedom not yet discovered experimentally. The new particles would\nnot be tachyons: they may feel different minkowskian space-times with critical\nspeeds much higher than c (speed of light) and behave kinematically like\nordinary particles apart from the difference in critical speed. Superluminal\nparticles may provide most of the matter at cosmic scale, and be mainly dark.\nWe present a discussion of possible theoretical, cosmological and experimental\nconsequences of such a scenario, with particular emphasis on problems related\nto the identification of dark matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 1996 17:11:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 1996 18:09:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

This yardstick relies on the assumptions of\nhydrostatic equilibrium and that the gas fraction is approximately constant.\nThe constancy is checked empirically from a local population of clusters. By\nusing the observed parameters consisting of temperature, surface brightness and\nradial profile $\\beta$, one can calculate the expected core radius. Comparing\nit to the observed angular size, one can in principle calibrate the\ncosmological deceleration parameter $q_0$. We test this method on a small\nsample of 6 clusters, and show its promise and accuracy. The preliminary\nimplications would be to suggest $q_0 \\approx 0.85\\pm 0.29$ with $1-\\sigma$\nstatistical error bars, with several systematic uncertainties remaining. Taken\nat face value, this would argue against a cosmological constant. The method is\nrobust to errors in the measurement of the core radius as long as the product\nof the central density and the core radius squared $\\rho_0 r_c^2$ are well\ndetermined. New lensing and X-ray data can dramatically improve on the\nstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 1996 19:03:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We further evaluate the affine\nsl(2|1) singular vectors in the realization of sl(2|1) provided by the N=2\nstring. We establish that, with a notable exception, the respective singular\nvectors are in a 2:1 correspondence, namely two different sl(2|1) singular\nvectors evaluate as an N=2 superconformal singular vector (however, those\nsingular vectors that are labelled by a pair of positive integers get these\nintegers transposed under the reduction). We also analyse the `exceptional'\ncases, which amount to a series of sl(2|1) singular vectors, labelled by r>=1,\nwhich do not have an N=2 counterpart, and discuss the mechanism by which the\nmultiplicity of singular vectors becomes equal to two at certain points in the\nweight spaces of both algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 1996 10:57:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
