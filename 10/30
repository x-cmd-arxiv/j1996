It is\nshown that the axionic moduli of the membrane obtained by wrapping the three\nform potential about three-cycles of a Calabi-Yau manifold can take nonzero\ninteger values. This novel property allows M-theory to have smooth transition\nfrom the Kahler cone of a geometrical phase to a Kahler cone of another\ngeometrical phase. Nongeometrical phases which define the boundary of the\nextended Kahler cone of the geometrical phases have discrete spectrum, and are\ncontinuously connected to the geometric phases. Using this new property, we\nrelate the M-theory model dependent axion to the type IIA model dependent axion\nand show that a potential develops for the type IIA axion in the strong\ncoupling regime which does not seem to be generated by instantons. Evidence is\npresented, using these moduli, which supports the Strominger conjecture on the\nwinding p-branes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Oct 1996 01:01:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Nov 1996 00:03:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
