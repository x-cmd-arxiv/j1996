The cluster mass\nfunction has been thoroughly studied in simulations and analytically, but a\ndirect simulation of the temperature function is presented here for the first\ntime. Adaptive hydrodynamic simulations using the cosmological Moving Mesh\nHydro code of Pen (1997a) are used to calibrate the temperature function for\ndifferent popular cosmologies. Applying the new normalizations to the\npresent-day cluster abundances, we find $\\sigma_8=0.53\\pm 0.05\n\\Omega_0^{-0.45}$ for a hyperbolic universe, and $\\sigma_8=0.53\\pm 0.05\n\\Omega_0^{-0.53}$ for a spatially flat universe with a cosmological constant.\nThe simulations followed the gravitational shock heating of the gas and dark\nmatter, and used a crude model for potential energy injection by supernova\nheating. The error bars are dominated by uncertainties in the heating/cooling\nmodels. We present fitting formulae for the mass-temperature conversions and\ncluster abundances based on these simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 1996 19:17:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Nov 1997 23:25:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Dec 1997 21:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We consider the resonant\ninteraction of the charged particles with all branches of the transverse plasma\nwaves propagating parallel to a uniform magnetic field. Numerical results and\nasymptotic analytic solutions valid at non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic\nenergies are obtained for the acceleration and scattering times of electrons.\nThese times have a strong dependence on plasma parameter alpha = Omega_pe /\nOmega_e (the ratio of electron plasma frequency to electron gyrofrequency) and\non the spectral index of plasma turbulence. It is shown that particles with\nenergies above certain critical value may interact with higher frequency\nelectromagnetic plasma waves and this interaction is allowed only in plasmas\nwith alpha < 1. We show that for non-relativistic and semi-relativistic\nelectrons in low-alpha plasmas the ratio of the acceleration time to the\nscattering time can be less than unity for a wide range of energies. From this\nwe conclude that the transport equation derived for cosmic rays which requires\nthis ratio to be much larger than one is not applicable at these energies. An\napproximate \"critical\" value of particle energy above which the dynamics of\ncharged particles may be described by this transport equation is determined as\na function of plasma parameters. We propose new transport equation for the\nopposite limit (energies less than this critical value) when the acceleration\nrate is much faster than the pitch angle scattering rate. This equation is\nneeded to describe the electron dynamics in plasmas with alpha <= 0.1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Oct 1996 19:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
