This finding is similar to Hartigan et al. (1994) who\ndetected that two third of the wider pairs with separations from 400 AU to 6000\nAU are coeval. However, unlike Hartigan et al. for the wider pairs, we find no\nnon-coeval pairs among our sample. Thus, the formation mechanism for a\nsignificant fraction of the wider pre-main-sequence binaries might be different\nfrom that of closer pre-main-sequence binaries.

Determination of the two physical parameters that\ncan be extracted from a planetary microlensing event, the planet/star mass\nratio q, and the planet/star separation in units of the stellar Einstein ring,\n$y_p$, is hampered by several types of degeneracies. There are two distinct and\nqualitatively different classes of planetary events: major and minor image\nperturbations. For major image perturbations, there is a potentially crippling\ncontinuous degeneracy in q which is of order $\\delta_d^{-1}$, where $\\delta_d$\nis the maximum fractional deviation of the planetary perturbation. Since the\nthreshold of detection is expected to be $\\delta_d \\sim 5%$, this degeneracy in\nq can be a factor of $\\sim 20$. For minor image perturbations, the continuous\ndegeneracy in q is considerably less severe, and is typically less than a\nfactor 4. We show that these degeneracies can be resolved by observations from\ndedicated telescopes on several continents together with optical/infrared\nphotometry from one of these sites. There also exists a class of discrete\ndegeneracies. These are typically easy to resolve given good temporal coverage\nof the planetary event. Unambiguous interpretation of planetary microlensing\nevents requires the resolution of both types of degeneracy. We describe the\ndegeneracies in detail and specify the situations in which they are\nproblematic. We also describe how individual planet masses and physical\nprojected separations can be measured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 1996 11:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

We then classify all such Z_6 asymmetric\norbifolds that result in models with a non-abelian hidden sector. All models\nclassified in this paper have only one adjoint (but no other higher\nrepresentation) Higgs field in the grand unified gauge group. In addition, all\nof them are completely anomaly free. There are two types of such 3-family\nmodels. The first type consists of the unique SO(10) model with SU(2) X SU(2) X\nSU(2) as its hidden sector (which is not asymptotically-free at the string\nscale). This SO(10) model has 4 left-handed and 1 right-handed 16s. The second\ntype is described by a moduli space containing 17 models (distinguished by\ntheir massless spectra). All these models have an SU(2) hidden sector, and 5\nleft-handed and 2 right-handed families in the grand unified gauge group. One\nof these models is the unique E_6 model with an asymptotically-free SU(2)\nhidden sector. The others are SO(10) models, 8 of them with an asymptotically\nfree hidden sector at the string scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 1996 21:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 1997 01:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 1997 01:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 29 Apr 1997 01:38:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
