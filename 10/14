To this end, we assume that 6Li/H scales as 16O/H throughout the\ngalactic evolution, an assumption motivated by the observations of a similar\nscaling for 9Be. We examine the uncertainties attached to this modeling of 6Li\ngalactic evolution; we also incorporate a recent evaluation of the primordial\nproduction of 6Li. The depletion factor D6, for 6Li, in HD84937, is constrained\nto be less than 4 at 95% c.l.. This depletion factor is an extreme upper limit\non the depletion factor for 7Li. We conclude that the primordial abundance of\n7Li cannot be higher that twice the observed value, since no current stellar\nmodel is able to reproduce the observed trends of 7Li with temperature and\nmetallicity, and yet deplete 7Li by more than a factor 2, while satisfying\nD6<4. All three 6Li observations are in excellent agreement with all standard\nexpectations: Big-Bang nucleosynthesis with 2<$\\eta_{10}$<6.5, and standard\nisochrones of 6Li survival. We discuss possible deviations from our assumption\nof 6Li/H scaling with 16O/H, due to alpha-alpha creation of 6Li in various\nsites. We notably reject stellar flares as a significant source of 6Li in\nHD84937.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Oct 1996 23:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The static part\nof the effective Hamiltonian defines the True Effective Potential U_eff for\nconfigurations far from thermal equilibrium. Numerically solving the time\nevolution equations for energy densities corresponding to a quench in the\nunstable spinodal region, we find results quite different from what might be\ninferred from the equilibrium free energy ``effective'' potential F. Typical\ntime evolutions show effectively irreversible energy flow from the coherent\nmean fields to the quantum fluctuating modes, due to the creation of massless\nGoldstone bosons near threshold. The plasma frequency and collisionless damping\nrate of the mean fields are calculated in terms of the particle number density\nby a linear response analysis and compared with the numerical results.\nDephasing of the fluctuations leads also to the growth of an effective entropy\nand the transition from quantum to classical behavior of the ensemble. In\naddition to casting some light on fundamental issues of nonequilibrium quantum\nstatistical mechanics, the general framework presented in this work may be\napplied to a study of the dynamics of second order phase transitions in a wide\nvariety of Landau-Ginsburg systems described by a scalar order parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 1996 09:06:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
