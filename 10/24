The conjecture of invariance of first integrals of the mKdV\nhierarchy, considering as invariants of surfaces, with respect to confomal\nchanges of the metric of the ambient space is introduced. Some numeric\ncomputations confirming it are also presented. This paper is the sequel to the\nprevious author's paper \"Modified Novikov-Veselov equation and differential\ngeometry of surfaces\" (dg-ga/9511005) where generic surfaces are considered.\nHere the surfaces of revolution are regarded as a toy model for the general\ncase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 1996 16:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In the electromagnetic case, our key postulate is a\n``comparison axiom'', which states that whenever two particles of the same\ncharge $e$ have the same magnitude of acceleration, the difference in their\nself-force is given by the ordinary Lorentz force of the difference in their\n(suitably compared) electromagnetic fields. We thereby derive an expression for\nthe electromagnetic self-force which agrees with that of DeWitt and Brehme as\ncorrected by Hobbs. Despite several important differences, our analysis of the\ngravitational self-force proceeds in close parallel with the electromagnetic\ncase. In the gravitational case, our final expression for the (reduced order)\nequations of motion shows that the deviation from geodesic motion arises\nentirely from a ``tail term'', in agreement with recent results of Mino et al.\nThroughout the paper, we take the view that ``point particles'' do not make\nsense as fundamental objects, but that ``point particle equations of motion''\ndo make sense as means of encoding information about the motion of an extended\nbody in the limit where not only the size but also the charge and mass of the\nbody go to zero at a suitable rate. Plausibility arguments for the validity of\nour comparison axiom are given by considering the limiting behavior of the\nself-force on extended bodies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Oct 1996 03:52:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-08-17"}

A\nwell-established congested flow obtained in a numerical simulation shows a\nremarkable repetitive property such that the velocity of a vehicle evolves\nexactly in the same way as that of its preceding one except a time delay $T$.\nThis leads to a global pattern formation in time development of vehicles'\nmotion, and gives rise to a closed trajectory on $\\Delta x$-$v$\n(headway-velocity) plane connecting congested and free flow points. To obtain\nthe closed trajectory analytically, we propose a new approach to the pattern\nformation, which makes it possible to reduce the coupled car following\nequations to a single difference-differential equation (Rondo equation). To\ndemonstrate our approach, we employ a class of linear models which are exactly\nsolvable. We also introduce the concept of ``asymptotic trajectory'' to\ndetermine $T$ and $v_B$ (the backward velocity of the pattern), the global\nparameters associated with vehicles' collective motion in a congested flow, in\nterms of parameters such as the sensitivity $a$, which appeared in the original\ncoupled equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Oct 1996 16:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
