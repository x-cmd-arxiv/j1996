We also point out\nthat it is stringy non-perturbative effects that stabilize the dilaton and\nallow dynamical supersymmetry breaking via the field-theoretical\nnon-perturbative effect of gaugino condensation. As a typical example, a toy\nS-dual model of a dynamical E_8 condensate is constructed and the dilaton is\nexplicitly shown to be stabilized with broken supersymmetry and (fine-tuned)\nvanishing cosmological constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Oct 1996 04:35:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 1996 04:57:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
