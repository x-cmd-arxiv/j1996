The correct interpretation of the two (advanced and retarded)\nLienard-Wiechert solutions are in terms of creation and annihilation of\nparticles in classical physics. They are both retarded solutions. Previous work\non the short distance limit of CED of a spinless point electron are based on a\nfaulty assumption which causes the well known inconsistencies of the theory: a\ndiverging self-energy (the non-integrable singularity of its self-field energy\ntensor) and a causality-violating third order equation of motion (the\nLorentz-Dirac equation).
