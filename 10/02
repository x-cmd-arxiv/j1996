Assuming an exponential rise, the\ncorresponding doubling time is less than 3.8 hours. A significant flux decrease\nby a factor of ~2 in 9.7 hours was also observed. Without beaming, the rapid\nflux change and large isotropic luminosity are inconsistent with the\nElliot-Shapiro condition (assuming that gas accretion is the immediate source\nof power for the gamma-rays). This inconsistency suggests that the gamma-ray\nemission is beamed. A minimum Doppler factor of 8.1 is implied by the observed\nlack of pair-production opacity (assuming x-rays are emitted co-spatially with\nthe gamma-rays).

Two bright sources are detected, separated by only about 1', with the\nbrighter one coinciding with the center of the galaxy. Neither source shows\napparent X-ray variability on time-scales of minutes to hours in the ROSAT\nband. Simple power-law models, typical of AGN X-ray spectra, produce poor fits\nto the observed X-ray spectrum of the nuclear source. The addition of a\nRaymond-Smith component improves the fits significantly. This is consistent\nwith the presence of hot gas in the nuclear region with kT=~0.3 keV, in\naddition to a compact nuclear source. However, a careful examination of the\nresiduals reveal apparent features at low energies (< 0.25 keV). We find that\nthe addition of a narrow emission line at about 0.22 keV is a significant\nimprovement to the parameterization of the spectrum. We examine the results in\nthe light of the accuracy of the PSPC spectral calibration. The derived photon\nindex is about 2.3, which is similar to those for Seyfert 1 galaxies measured\nin the ROSAT energy range.

We discuss the implications of these results on the\nconnection between LINERs and AGNs.\n  The off-center source is transient in nature. It has a hard X-ray spectrum,\nwith a photon index of about 1.5, so is likely to be an X-ray binary. There is\nstill some ambiguity regarding its association with the galaxy. If it is indeed\nlocated in the galaxy, the 0.1-2 keV luminosity would be greater than\n5.1x10^{38} erg/s, making it a stellar-mass black hole candidate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Oct 1996 21:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

To determine the factor, in the first\napproach one exploits the scaling property of the longitudinal response\nfunction, while in the second one enforces the completeness of the states in\nthe space-like domain via the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The\nenergy-weighted and the squared-energy-weighted sum rules for the reduced\nresponses are explored as well and the extension to momentum distributions that\nare more general than a step-function is also considered. The two methods yield\nreduced responses and Coulomb sum rules that saturate in the non-Pauli-blocked\nregion, which can hardly be distinguished for Fermi momenta appropriate to\natomic nuclei.
