Bondi accretion from the\ninterstellar medium might then be expected to produce quasar-like luminosities\nfrom the nuclei of even quiescent elliptical galaxies. It is a puzzle that such\nluminosities are not observed. Motivated by this problem, Fabian & Rees have\nrecently suggested that the final stages of accretion in these objects occurs\nin an advection-dominated mode with a correspondingly small radiative\nefficiency. Despite possessing a long-known active nucleus and dynamical\nevidence for a black hole, the low radiative and kinetic luminosities of the\ncore of M87 provide the best illustration of this problem. We examine an\nadvection-dominated model for the nucleus of M87 and show that accretion at the\nBondi rate is compatible with the best known estimates for the core flux from\nradio through to X-ray wavelengths. The success of this model prompts us to\npropose that FR-I radio galaxies and quiescent elliptical galaxies accrete in\nan advection dominated mode whereas FR-II type radio-loud nuclei possess\nradiatively efficient thin accretion disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Oct 1996 20:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-06-08"}

The original statement of the first law\ngiven by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking for an Einstein-perfect fluid system\ncontained, in addition, volume integrals of the fluid fields, over a spacelike\nslice stretching between these two surfaces. When applied to the\nEinstein-perfect fluid system, however, Wald's methods yield restricted\nresults. The reason is that the fluid fields in the Lagrangian of a gravitating\nperfect fluid are typically nonstationary. We therefore first derive a first\nlaw-like relation for an arbitrary Lagrangian metric theory of gravity coupled\nto arbitrary Lagrangian matter fields, requiring only that the metric field be\nstationary. This relation includes a volume integral of matter fields over a\nspacelike slice between the black hole horizon and spatial infinity, and\nreduces to the first law originally derived by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking when\nthe theory is general relativity coupled to a perfect fluid. We also consider a\nspecific Lagrangian formulation for an isentropic perfect fluid given by\nCarter, and directly apply Wald's analysis. The resulting first law contains\nonly surface integrals at the black hole horizon and spatial infinity, but this\nrelation is much more restrictive in its allowed fluid configurations and\nperturbations than that given by Bardeen, Carter and Hawking. In the Appendix,\nwe use the symplectic structure of the Einstein-perfect fluid system to derive\na conserved current for perturbations of this system: this current reduces to\none derived ab initio for this system by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Oct 1996 03:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In this philosophy a new, renormalised coupling g' is\ndefined with the aim of reducing the higher order coefficients of the\nperturbative series in g'. An improvement in the agreement between lattice data\nand this new perturbation series is generally observed.\n  In this paper an alternative scenario is discussed where lattice artifacts\nare proposed as the cause of the disagreement between lattice data and the\ng_0-perturbative series. We find that this interpretation provides excellent\nagreement between lattice data and perturbation theory in g_0 corrected for\nlattice artifacts.
