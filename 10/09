Faint hot galaxies show\nsteep, largely featureless power-law profiles at all radii and lack cores.

Central properties correlate with global rotation and\nshape: core galaxies tend to be boxy and slowly rotating, whereas power-law\ngalaxies tend to be disky and rapidly rotating. The dense power-law centers of\ndisky, rotating galaxies are consistent with their formation in gas-rich\nmergers. The parallel proposition that cores are simply the by-products of\ngas-free stellar mergers is less compelling. For example, core galaxies accrete\nsmall, dense, gas-free galaxies at a rate sufficient to fill in low-density\ncores if the satellites survived and sank to the center. An alternative model\nfor core formation involves the orbital decay of massive black holes (BHs): the\nBH may heat and eject stars from the center, eroding a power law if any exists\nand scouring out a core. An average BH mass per spheroid of 0.002 times the\nstellar mass yields reasonably good agreement with the masses and radii of\nobserved cores and in addition is consistent with the energetics of AGNs and\nkinematic detections of BHs in nearby galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 1996 01:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Oct 1997 22:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We adapt the approach of Dennis Sullivan, which treats a\nspin structure on a Riemann surface M as a complex line bundle S whose square\nis the canonical line bundle K=T(M). Given a conformal immersion of M into\n\\bbR^3, the unique spin strucure on S^2 pulls back via the Gauss map to a spin\nstructure S on M, and gives rise to a pair of smooth sections (s_1,s_2) of S.\nConversely, any pair of sections of S generates a (possibly periodic) conformal\nimmersion of M under a suitable integrability condition, which for a minimal\nsurface is simply that the spinor sections are meromorphic. A spin structure S\nalso determines (and is determined by) the regular homotopy class of the\nimmersion by way of a \\bbZ_2-quadratic form q_S. We present an analytic\nexpression for the Arf invariant of q_S, which decides whether or not the\ncorreponding immersion can be deformed to an embedding. The Arf invariant also\nturns out to be an obstruction, for example, to the existence of certain\ncomplete minimal immersions. The later parts of this paper use the spinor\nrepresentation to investigate minimal surfaces with embedded planar ends. In\ngeneral, we show for a spin structure S on a compact Riemann surface M with\npunctures at P that the space of all such (possibly periodic) minimal\nimmersions of M\\setminus P into \\bbR^3 (upto homothety) is the the product of\nS^1\\times H^3 with the Grassmanian of 2-planes in a complex vector space \\calK\nof meromorphic sections of S. An important tool -- a skew-symmetric form \\Omega\ndefined by residues of a certain meromorphic quadratic differential on M --\nlets us compute how \\calK varies as M and P are varied. Then we apply this to\ndetermine the moduli spaces of planar-ended minimal spheres and real projective\nplanes, and also to construct a new family of minimal tori and a minimal Klein\nbottle with 4 ends. These surfaces compactify in S^3 to yield surfaces critical\nfor the \\Moebius invariant squared mean curvature functional W. On the other\nhand, Robert Bryant has shown all W-critical spheres and real projective planes\narise this way. Thus we find at the same time the moduli spaces of W-critical\nspheres and real projective planes via the spinor representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Oct 1996 20:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
