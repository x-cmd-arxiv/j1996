It parallels classical (Shannon)\ninformation theory but is based entirely on density matrices, rather than\nprobability distributions, for the description of quantum ensembles. We find\nthat, unlike in Shannon theory, conditional entropies can be negative when\nconsidering quantum entangled systems such as an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair,\nwhich leads to a violation of well-known bounds of classical information\ntheory. Negative quantum entropy can be traced back to ``conditional'' density\nmatrices which admit eigenvalues larger than unity. A straightforward\ndefinition of mutual quantum entropy, or ``mutual entanglement'', can also be\nconstructed using a ``mutual'' density matrix. Such a unified\ninformation-theoretic description of classical correlation and quantum\nentanglement clarifies the link between them: the latter can be viewed as\n``super-correlation'' which can induce classical correlation when considering a\nternary or larger system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 1996 17:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
