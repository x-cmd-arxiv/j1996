This space has drawn much\nattention recently in connection with Quantum Cohomology. The space $\\MM\\alpha$\nis smooth but not compact. The problem of compactification of $\\MM\\alpha$\nproved very important. One compactification $\\MML\\alpha$ (the space of {\\em\nquasiflags}), was constructed in \\cite{L}. However, historically the first and\nmost economical compactification $\\MMD\\alpha$ (the space of {\\em quasimaps})\nwas constructed by Drinfeld (early 80-s, unpublished). The latter\ncompactification is singular, while the former one is smooth. Drinfeld has\nconjectured that the natural map $\\pi:\\MML\\alpha\\to\\MMD\\alpha$ is a small\nresolution of singularities. In the present note we prove this conjecture. As a\nbyproduct, we compute the stalks of $IC$ sheaf on $\\MMD\\alpha$ and, moreover,\nthe Hodge structure in these stalks. Namely, the Hodge structure is a pure Tate\none, and the generating function for the $IC$ stalks is just the Lusztig's\n$q$-analogue of Kostant's partition function (see \\cite{Lu}).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Oct 1996 10:37:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Oct 1996 05:33:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 1996 09:46:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

We use the latest timing data for this system to constrain the mass and\norbital parameters of the second companion. We find that all possible solutions\nhave a mass m_2 in the range 2.4 10^-4 M_sun <= m_2 sin i_2 <= 1.2 10^-2 M_sun,\ni.e., almost certainly excluding a second companion of stellar mass and\nsuggesting instead that the system contains a planet or a brown dwarf. Using\nMonte-Carlo realizations of the triple configuration in three dimensions we\nfind the most probable value of m_2 to be 0.010(5) M_sun, corresponding to a\ndistance of 38(6) AU from the center of mass of the inner binary (the errors\nindicate 80% confidence intervals).

This leads to the notions of a finite\nvon Neumann category and of a trace on such category. Given a finite von\nNeumann category, we study the extended homology and cohomology theories with\nvalues in the abelian extension. Any trace on the initial category produces\nnumerical invariants - the von Neumann dimension and the Novikov - Shubin\nnumbers. Thus, we obtain the local versions of the Novikov - Shubin invariants,\nlocalized at different traces. In the \"abelian\" case this localization can be\nmade more geometric: we show that any torsion object determines a \"divisor\" --\na closed subspace of the space of the parameters. The divisors of torsion\nobjects together with the information produced by the local Novikov - Shubin\ninvariants may be used to study multiplicities of intersections of algebraic\nand analytic varieties (we discuss here only simple examples demonstrating this\npossibility). We compute explicitly the divisors and the von Neumann dimensions\nof the extended cohomology in the real analytic situation.
