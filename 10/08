The difficulty, which goes away in the ``periodic straight cylinder\napproximation,'' is associated with the necessarily non-vanishing character of\nthe curl of the Lorentz force, j x B. Here, we ask if there exists a spatial\nprofile of electrical conductivity that permits the existence of zero-flow,\naxisymmetric r esistive equilibria in a torus, and answer the question in the\naffirmative. However, the physical properties of the conductivity profile are\nunusual (the conductivity cannot be constant on a magnetic surface, for\nexample) and whether such equilibria are to be considered physically possible\nremains an open question.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 1996 16:05:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

Only for\nspecial (and probably unphysical) resistivity profiles can the Lorentz force,\nin the static force-balance equation, be expressed as the gradient of a scalar\nand thus cancel the gradient of a scalar pressure. In general, the Lorentz\nforce has a curl directed so as to generate toroidal vorticity. Here, we\ncalculate, for a collisional, highly viscous magnetofluid, the flows that are\nrequired for an axisymmetric toroidal steady state, assuming uniform scalar\nresistivity and viscosity. The flows originate from paired toroidal vortices\n(in what might be called a ``double smoke ring'' configuration), and are\nthought likely to be ubiquitous in the interior of toroidally driven\nmagnetofluids of this type. The existence of such vortices is conjectured to\ncharacterize magnetofluids beyond the high-viscosity limit in which they are\nreadily calculable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Oct 1996 20:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
