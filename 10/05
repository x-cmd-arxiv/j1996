To carry out this analysis we have developed a cross-correlation\ntechnique which classifies faint galaxy spectra into one of six types based on\nlocal galaxy templates. Tests and simulations show that this technique yields\nclassifications correct to within one type for more than 90% of the galaxies in\nour sample.

(ii) Early-type spirals show modest evolution, characterised by\na gradual steepening of the faint end of their LF with redshift. (iii) Out to z\n~ 0.5, the overall evolution of the galaxy population is dominated by changes\nseen in late-type spirals. The characteristic luminosity (L^*) of these\ngalaxies appears to brighten with redshift and there are signs of strong\ndensity evolution (a rapid increase in \\phi^*).

The\ncoupling of the two effects makes it difficult to use the XRB for independent\nconfirmation of the CMB dipole being due to the observer's motion. The large\nscale structure dipole (rms per component) relative to the monopole is in the\nrange $a_{1m}/a_{00} \\sim (0.5-9.0) \\times 10^{-3} $.

This procedure generalizes mean\nfield theory and can be systematically improved by including more states or\nfluctuations. We analyze in detail the simplest of these approximations which\ncorresponds to summing over states with local antiferromagnetic (AF) order. If\nin the states considered the AF order changes sufficiently little in space and\ntime, the path integral becomes a finite dimensional integral for which the\nsaddle point evaluation is exact.

The matrix\nelement $\\Delta M^{(X)}$ and the decay probability $W^{(X)}$ due to the\nleptoquark $X$ contribution are analysed. The effect of significant enhancement\nof the neutrino decay by the crossed field takes place. It is shown that the\nleptoquark contribution to the decay probability can dominate over the\n$W$-boson one in the case of strong suppression of the lepton mixing in the\nframework of the SM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Oct 1996 10:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
