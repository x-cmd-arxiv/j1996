To\ndo so a pion potential is extracted from the in-medium dispersion relation and\nused in QMD calculations and thus we take care of both, real and imaginary part\nof the pion optical potential. The potentials are determined from different\nsources, i.e. from the $\\Delta$--hole model and from phenomenological\napproaches. Depending on the strength of the potential a reduction of the\nanti-correlation of pion and nucleon flow in non-central collisions is observed\nas well as an enhancement of the high energetic yield in transverse pion\nspectra. A comparison to experiments, in particular to $p_t$-spectra for the\nreaction Ca+Ca at 1 GeV/nucleon and the pion in-plane flow in Ne+Pb collisions\nat 800 MeV/nucleon, generally favours a weak potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Oct 1996 14:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 1997 11:33:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
