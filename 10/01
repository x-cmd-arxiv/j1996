We do not try to take into account explicitly the evolution\nof the halo but we implicitly assume that the timescale for the formation of\nthe halo was of the same order as the timescale for the formation of the thick\ndisk. The formation of the thin-disk is much longer than that of the thick\ndisk, implying that the infalling gas forming the thin-disk comes not only from\nthe thick disk but mainly from the intergalactic medium. The timescale for the\nformation of the thin-disk is assumed to be a function of the galactocentric\ndistance, leading to an inside-out picture for the Galaxy building. The model\ntakes into account the most up to date nucleosynthesis prescriptions and adopts\na threshold in the star formation process which naturally produces a hiatus in\nthe star formation rate at the end of the thick disk phase, as suggested by\nrecent observations. The model results are compared with an extended set of\nobservational constraints.
