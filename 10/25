We consider a truncated model for gravitational\nradiation from binary systems in which each STF mass and current moment of\norder l is given by the lowest-order, Newtonian-like l-pole moment of the\norbiting masses; we neglect post-Newtonian corrections to each STF moment.\nSpecializing to orbits which are circular (apart from the radiation-induced\ninspiral), we find an explicit infinite series for the energy flux in powers of\n$v/c$, where v is the orbital velocity. We show that the series converges for\nall values $v/c < 2/e$ when one mass is much smaller than the other, and $v/c <\n4/e$ for equal masses,where e is the base of natural logarithms. These values\ninclude all physically relevant values for compact binary inspiral. This\nconvergence cannot indicate whether or not the full series (obtained from the\nexact moments) will converge. But if the full series does not converge, our\nanalysis shows that this failure to converge does not originate from summing\nover the Newtonian part of the multipole moments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 1996 00:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Hypercolor singlets are forbidden in the\nfermionic sector of this theory; we propose that SU(4) symmetry spontaneously\nbreaks to $SU(3) \\times U(1)$, with the binding of triality nonzero preons and\ngluons into composites, and with the formation of a color singlet condensate\nthat breaks the initial $Z_{12}$ vacuum symmetry to $Z_{6}$.

The spin 1\ntriality zero composites of the color triplet SU(4) gluons, when coupled to the\ncondensate and with the color singlet representation of the 10 acting as a\ndoorway state, lead to weak interactions of the fermionic composites through an\nexact SU(2) gauge algebra.

We show that\ntwo-body exchange currents lead to nonvanishing Delta and N-->Delta transition\nquadrupole moments even if the wave functions have no D-state admixture. The\nusual explanation based on the single-quark transition model involves D-state\nadmixtures but no exchange currents. We derive a parameter- free relation\nbetween the N-->Delta transition quadrupole moment and the neutron charge\nradius: Q(N-->Delta) = r^2(neutron)/sqrt(2). Furthermore, we calculate the M1\nand E2 amplitudes for the process photon + N -->Delta. We find that the E2\namplitude receives sizeable contributions from exchange currents. These are\nmore important than the ones which result from D-state admixtures due to tensor\nforces between quarks if a reasonable quark core radius of about 0.6 fm is\nused. We obtain a ratio of E2/M1=-3.5%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Oct 1996 13:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-04-06"}
