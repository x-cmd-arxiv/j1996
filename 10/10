The built-in nature of mesh adaptivity for\nunstructured meshes gives one way to simulate highly dynamic, hierarchical\nproblems involving both collisionless dark matter and collisional gas dynamics.\nIn this paper, we describe algorithms to construct unstructured meshes from a\nset of points with periodic boundary conditions through Delaunay triangulation,\nand algorithms to solve hydrodynamic and N-body problems on an unstructured\nmesh . A combination of a local transformation algorithm and the traditional\nBowyer-Watson algorithm gives an efficient approach to perform Delaunay\ntriangulation. A novel algorithm to solve N-body equations of motion on an\nunstructured mesh is described. Poisson's equation is solved using the\nconjugate gradient method.

Although\nreasonable quantum random sources do not add computational power, the\ndiscussion of quantum randomness naturally leads to several definitions of the\ncomplexity of quantum states. Unlike classical string complexity, both\ndeterministic and nondeterministic quantum state complexities are interesting.\nA notion of \\emph{total quantum nondeterminism} is introduced for decision\nproblems.

In this study, we first\nshow that any variational approximation to the dynamics of a quantum system\nbased on the Dirac action principle leads to a classical Hamiltonian dynamics\nfor the variational parameters. Since this Hamiltonian is generically nonlinear\nand nonintegrable, the dynamics thus generated can be chaotic, in distinction\nto the exact quantum evolution. We then restrict attention to a system of two\nbiquadratically coupled quantum oscillators and study two variational schemes,\nthe leading order large N (four canonical variables) and Hartree (six canonical\nvariables) approximations. The chaos seen in the approximate dynamics is an\nartifact of the approximations: this is demonstrated by the fact that its onset\noccurs on the same characteristic time scale as the breakdown of the\napproximations when compared to numerical solutions of the time-dependent\nSchrodinger equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Oct 1996 17:12:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Oct 1996 23:19:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
