Recently, this formula has been generalized to arbitrary Dirac\noperators [2]. In this paper we prove a supersymmetric version of the\ngeneralized Lichnerowicz formula, motivated by the fact that there is a\none-to-one correspondence between Clifford superconnections and Dirac\noperators. We extend this result to obtain a simple formula for the\nsupercurvature of a generalized Bismut superconnection. This might be seen as a\nfirst step to prove the local index theorem also for families of arbitrary\nDirac operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jan 1996 09:29:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
