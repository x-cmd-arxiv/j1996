The results of recent\nnumerical hydrodynamics computations of the formation of the Lya forest appear\nto indicate that the division between a clumpy component and a diffuse one may\nbe inappropriate.

Observations of planetary nebulae and the nebula around SN\n1987A show that the slow winds from extended stars frequently have an axisymme-\ntric structure with a high density in the equatorial plane. We have carried out\nnumerical calculations of the interaction of a supernova with such an axisymme-\ntric density distribution. For small values of the angular density gradient at\nthe pole, the asymmetry in the interaction shell is greater than, but close to,\nthat expected from purely radial motion. If the angular density gradient is\nabove a moderate value, the flow qualitatively changes and a protrusion emerges\nalong the axis. For a power-law supernova density profile, the flow approaches\na self-similar state in which the protrusion length is $2-4$ times the radius\nof the main shell. The critical density gradient is larger for steeper density\nprofiles of the ejecta. Most of our calculations are axisymmetric, but we have\ncarried out a 3-dimensional calculation to show that the protrusion is not a\nnumerical artifact along the symmetry axis. For typical supernova parameters,\nthe protrusions take $\\gtrsim$ several years to develop. The appearance of the\nshell with protrusions is similar to that observed in VLBI radio images of the\nremnant 41.9 +58 in M82 and, possibly, of SN 1986J.

For a particular SEMF, a given distribution of initial\nconditions predicts a corresponding IMF. We consider several different\ndescriptions for the distribution of initial conditions in star forming\nmolecular clouds. We first consider the limiting case in which only one\nphysical variable -- the effective sound speed -- determines the initial\nconditions. In this limit, we use observed scaling laws to determine the\ndistribution of sound speed and the SEMF to convert this distribution into an\nIMF. We next consider the opposite limit in which many different independent\nphysical variables play a role in determining stellar masses. In this limit,\nthe central limit theorem shows that the IMF approaches a log-normal form.\nRealistic star forming regions contain an intermediate number of relevant\nvariables; we thus consider intermediate cases between the two limits.

As a result, the probability for more than one hard partonic\nscattering occurring in a single $\\gamma p$ collision could become significant.\nIt is well known that this effect modifies the contribution of jets (minijets)\nto the total cross section. We discuss the latest HERA data on the total\n$\\gamma p$ cross section in this context. The possible effects of multiple hard\ninteractions on event shapes and jet cross sections at HERA have been studied\nusing Monte Carlo programs. We review some of the available results, which in\ngeneral indicate that the effects of multiple interactions should be\nsignificant and may already be manifest in the existing HERA data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 1996 11:02:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

An exact expression for the quantum fidelity\nbetween two mixed states is derived. The optimal measurement that gives rise to\nit is studied in detail. Several upper and lower bounds on the quantum mutual\ninformation are derived via similar techniques and compared to each other. Of\nnote is a simple derivation of the important upper bound first proved by Holevo\nand an explicit expression for another (tighter) upper bound that appears\nimplicitly in the same derivation. Several upper and lower bounds to the quan-\ntum Kullback relative information are derived. The measures developed are also\napplied to ferreting out the extent to which quantum systems must be disturbed\nby information gathering measurements. This is tackled in two ways. The first\nis in setting up a general formalism for describing the tradeoff between\ninference and disturbance. The main point of this is that it gives a way of\nexpressing the problem so that it appears as algebraic as that of the problem\nof finding quantum distinguishability measures. The second result on this theme\nis a theorem that prohibits \"broadcasting\" an unknown (mixed) quantum state.\nThat is to say, there is no way to replicate an unknown quantum state onto two\nseparate quantum systems when each system is considered without regard to the\nother.
