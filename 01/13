The process of ``mode conversion\" is known in plasma physics by\nthis name and in condensed matter physics as ``Andreev reflection\" or ``branch\nconversion\". It is illustrated here in a linear Lorentz non-invariant model\nintroduced by Unruh. The role of interactions and a physical short distance\ncutoff is then examined in the sonic black hole formed with Helium-II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jan 1996 21:15:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 1996 09:09:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
