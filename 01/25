This code, originating from\nGeneva, now includes the computation of element segregation for helium and 12\nheavier isotopes. It may also include any type of mixing of the stellar gas,\nprovided this mixing may be parametrized with an effective diffusion\ncoefficient as a function of radius. Here we introduced rotation-induced mixing\nas prescribed by Zahn (1992). We present five solar models: the standard model;\ntwo models including pure element segregation; two models with both element\nsegregation and rotation-induced mixing. The $u = {P \\over \\rho }$ function\ncomputed as a function of radius in these new solar models are compared to the\nhelioseismological results obtained for the same function by Dziembowski et al\n(1994). Improving the physics of the models leads to a better consistency with\nhelioseismology. In our best model, which includes both segregation and mixing,\nthe relative difference in the $ u $ function between the model and the\nhelioseismological results is smaller than 0.5 per cent at all radii except at\nthe center and the surface. Meanwhile lithium is depleted by a factor 155 and\nberyllium by a factor 2.9, which is consistent with the observations. The\nbottom of the convective zone lies at a fractional radius of 0.716, consistent\nwith helioseismology. The neutrino fluxes are not decreased in any of these\nmodels. The models including the computations of element segregation lead to a\npresent surface helium abundance of: $ Y_{surf} $ between 0.248 and 0.258,\nwhich is in satisfactory agreement with the value derived from helioseismology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jan 1996 17:02:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Mar 1996 14:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-29"}

More information is required to\nprepare an ensemble of nonorthogonal quantum states than can be recovered from\nthe ensemble by measurements. Nonorthogonal quantum states cannot be\ndistinguished reliably, cannot be copied or cloned, and do not lead to exact\npredictions for the results of measurements. These properties contrast sharply\nwith those of information stored in the microstates of a classical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jan 1996 04:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
