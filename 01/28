It is found that the metal-insulator\ntransition occurs at a finite correlation $U_c$ when the average number of\nelectrons per lattice site is an integer. The critical $U_c$ depends\nsensitively on both the band degeneracy $N$ and the filling $x$. A derivation\nis presented for the general expression of $U_c(x,N)$ which reproduces all\npreviously known Gutzwiller solutions, including that of the Boson Hubbard\nmodel. Effects of the lattice structure on the metal-insulator transition and\nthe effective mass are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jan 1996 21:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}
