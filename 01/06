Most gas is\nin one of two components: either at the photoheating floor $10^{4.5}$\\Kel and\nprimarily in low density regions or else shock heated to $10^5-10^6$\\Kel and in\nregions of moderate overdensity (in caustics and near groups and clusters). It\npresents a major observational challenge to observationally detect this second,\nabundant component as it is neither an efficient radiator nor absorber. About\n2% to 10% of the baryons cool and collapse into galaxies forming on caustics\nand migrating to clusters. About 1%-2% of baryons are in the very hot X-ray\nemitting gas near cluster cores, in good agreement with observations.
