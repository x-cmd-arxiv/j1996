A unifying concept, beyond isotropy and inhomogeneity of the two\ngroups separately, is that bursts consist of pulses, organized in time and\nenergy: wider pulses are more asymmetric, their centroids are shifted to later\ntimes at lower energies, and shorter, more symmetric pulses tend to be\nspectrally harder. Long bursts tend to have many pulses while short bursts\nusually have few, relatively narrow pulses. Two factors, viewing angle and\nbeaming, may account for pulse asymmetry and the large dynamic range ($\\sim$\n200) in pulse widths.
