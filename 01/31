We find generally that the proton-proton and neutron-neutron $J=0$\npairing correlations, which dominate the ground state properties of even-even\nnuclei, vanish at temperatures around 1 MeV. This pairing phase transition is\naccompanied by a rapid increase in the moment of inertia and a partial\nunquenching of the M1 strength. We find that the M1 strength totally unquenches\nat higher temperatures, related to the vanishing of isoscalar proton-neutron\ncorrelations, which persist to higher temperatures than the pairing between\nlike nucleons. The Gamow-Teller strength is also correlated to the isoscalar\nproton-neutron pairing and hence also unquenches at a temperature larger than\nthat of the pairing phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jan 1996 23:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

It is\nformed by a particular superposition of canonical coherent states. In the\nsimplest case, these superpositions are eigenfunctions of the annihilation\noperator $A=P(d/dx+x)/\\sqrt2$, where $P$ is the parity operator. Such $A$\narises naturally in the $q\\to -1$ limit for a symmetry operator of a specific\nself-similar potential obeying the $q$-Weyl algebra, $AA^\\dagger-q^2A^\\dagger\nA=1$. Coherent states for this and other reflectionless potentials whose\ndiscrete spectra consist of $N$ geometric series are analyzed. In the harmonic\noscillator limit the surviving part of these states takes the form of\northonormal superpositions of $N$ canonical coherent states\n$|\\epsilon^k\\alpha\\rangle$, $k=0, 1, \\dots, N-1$, where $\\epsilon$ is a\nprimitive $N$th root of unity, $\\epsilon^N=1$. A class of $q$-coherent states\nrelated to the bilateral $q$-hypergeometric series and Ramanujan type integrals\nis described. It includes a curious set of coherent states of the free\nnonrelativistic particle which is interpreted as a $q$-algebraic system without\ndiscrete spectrum. A special degenerate form of the symmetry algebras of\nself-similar potentials is found to provide a natural $q$-analog of the Floquet\ntheory.
