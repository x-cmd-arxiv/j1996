The analysis of the constraints over loop dependent\nwavefunctions has been traditionally based upon geometric (in contrast to\nanalytic) properties of the loops. The reason for this preferred way is\ntwofold: for one hand the inherent difficulties associated with the analytic\nloop calculus, and on the other our limited knowledge about the analytic\nproperties of knots invariants. Extended loops provide a way to overcome the\ndifficulties at both levels. For one hand, a systematic method to construct\nanalytic expressions of diffeomorphism invariants (the extended knots) in terms\nof the Chern-Simons propagators can be developed. Extended knots are simply\nrelated to ordinary knots (at least formally). The analytic expressions of knot\ninvariants could be produced then in a generic way. On the other hand, the\nevaluation of the Hamiltonian over extended loop wavefunctions can be\nthoroughly accomplished in the extended loop framework. These two ingredients\npromote extended loops as a potential resort for answering important questions\nabout quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 1996 01:19:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Drawing on the work of Fock, Stueckelberg, Nambu, Schwinger, and\nFeynman, the formalism was raised from the status of a purely formal\nmathematical technique to a covariant evolution theory for interacting\nparticles. In the context of this theory, solutions have been found for the\nrelativistic bound state problem, classical and quantum scattering in\nrelativistic potentials, as well as applications in statistical mechanics.\n  It has been shown that a generalization of the Maxwell theory is required in\norder that the electromagnetic interaction be well-posed in the theory. The\nresulting theory of electromagnetism involves a fifth gauge field introduced to\ncompensate for the dependence of the gauge transformation on the invariant time\nparameter; permitting such dependence relaxes the requirement that individual\nparticles be on fixed mass shells and allows exchange of mass during\nscattering. In this paper, we develop the quantum field theory of off-shell\nelectromagnetism, and use it to calculate certain elementary processes,\nincluding Compton scattering and M{\\o}ller scattering. These calculations lead\nto {\\em qualitative} deviations from the usual scattering cross-sections, which\nare, however, small effects, but may be visible at small angles near the\nforward direction. The familiar IR divergence of the M{\\o}ller scattering is,\nmoreover, completely regularized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jan 1996 15:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
