Interstellar extinction, metallicity\nand nebular contributions to the broad bands are estimated using spectroscopic\ndata on these objects. Dimensionless diagrams involving B-V and V-R colors and\nthe flux ratio of Balmer line to B band continuum are used to study star\nformation. The cluster colors indicate reduced extinction towards stellar\ncontinuum compared to the values derived from Balmer lines for the ionized gas.\nThe frequency of detection of classical young (t < 3 Myr) regions with only one\nburst of star formation is found to be low as compared to young regions with an\naccompanying population rich in red supergiants from a previous burst (t ~ 10\nMyr). Reduced extinction towards cluster stars, destruction of ionizing photons\nand the existence of older population, often spatially unresolvable from the\nyounger population, all conspire to make the observed Balmer line equivalent\nwidths low in a majority of the GEHRs. A scenario of star formation is\nsuggested which explains many of the observed properties of GEHRs, including\nthe core-halo structure, reduced extinction for the radiation from stars as\ncompared to that from the nebular gas, non-detection of young single burst\nregions and the co-existence of two populations of different ages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 1996 14:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The new technique\nwas tested for systematic errors on both artificial and real data and compared\nwith widely used one-dimensional decomposition techniques, where the luminosity\nprofile of the galaxy is used. The comparisons indicate that a decomposition of\nthe two-dimensional image of the galaxy with an exponential light profile for\nboth bulge and disk yields the most reproducible and representative bulge and\ndisk parameters.\n  An extensive error analysis was made to determine the reliability of the\nmodel parameters. If the model with an exponential bulge profile is a\nreasonable description of a galaxy, the maximum errors in the derived model\nparameters are of order 20%. The uncertainties in the model parameters will\nincrease, if the exponential bulge function is replaced by other often used\nbulge functions as the de Vaucouleurs law.\n  All decomposition methods were applied to the optical and near-infrared data\nset presented by de Jong & van der Kruit (1994), which comprises 86 galaxies in\nsix passbands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 1996 14:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In this paper, we\ndiscuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal\nreasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for\nrepresenting temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for\ndetermining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding\none or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two\nimportant algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a\nbacktracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop\ntechniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly\noptimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable\nand value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically\nimprove the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously\nsuggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time\nand space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the\ntechniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems\nthat are of practical size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jan 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}

A quantum energy momentum\ntensor is obtained by the point stripping method. Though the cusps are no\nsingularities, the latter cusps cause the divergence of the quantum field. This\nsuggests that only the latter cusps are quantum mechanically unstable. Of\ncourse at the singularity of the background spacetime the quantum field\ndiverges. Also the possibility of the divergence of topological effect by a\nnegative spatial curvature is discussed. Since the volume of the negatively\ncurved space is larger than that of the flat space, one see so many images of a\nsingle source by the non-trivial topology. It is confirmed that this divergence\ndoes not appear in our models of topologies.
