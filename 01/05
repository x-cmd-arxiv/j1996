Inter-galactic magnetic fields $\\gtrsim\n10^{-12} G$ are required in this model to allow CR's to be observed\ncontinuously in time by producing energy dependent delays in the CR arrival\ntimes. This results in individual CR sources having very narrow observed\nspectra, since at any given time only those CR's having a fixed time delay are\nobserved. Thus, the brightest CR sources should be different at different\nenergies. The average number of sources contributing to the total CR flux\ndecreases with energy much more rapidly than in a model of steady CR sources,\ndropping to one at $E_{crit} \\simeq2\\times10^{20}$~eV with very weak\nsensitivity to the inter-galactic magnetic field strength. Below $E_{crit}$, a\nvery large number of sources is expected, consistent with observations. Above\n$E_{crit}$, a source may be observed with a flux considerably higher than the\ntime-averaged CR flux from all sources, if a nearby GRB occurred recently.

They contain the\nfollowing key features: (1) No very metal-poor stars, (2) a sudden rise in the\nmetal-poor distribution to a modal [Fe/H] value of --1.70 consistent with an\nhomogeneous metallicity unresolved at the 0.07 dex level, (3) a tail to higher\nmetallicities with more stars than predicted by simple chemical evolution\nmodels, and (4) a weak correlation between metallicity and radius such that the\nmost metal-rich stars are concentrated to the cluster core. The unresolved\nmetal-weak tail implies that the gas out of which omega Cen formed was\nwell-mixed up to the modal metallicity of the cluster. Therefore, omega Cen\nlike other Galactic globular clusters, seems to have formed in a pre-enriched\nand homogenized (up to the modal metallicity) environment. The existence of a\nweak metallicity gradient supports the idea that omega Cen self-enriched, with\nthe enriched gas sinking to the cluster center due to gas dissipation\nprocesses. We also note, however, that the metal-rich stars are more massive\nthan the bulk of the stars in the cluster, and may have sunk to the center by\ndynamical mass segregation over the lifetime of the cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 1996 20:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-05"}

Some difficulties\nassociated with the definition of the duality transformation for a general\ngauge group are discussed. We compute the classical monopole spectrum of these\ntheories, and when it is possible we use it to check the consistency of the\nduality. Generally these theories may have phase transitions between strong and\nweak coupling, which prevent the semi-classical computation from being useful\nfor checking the duality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jan 1996 16:22:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jan 1996 13:45:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-29"}
