We construct\nsuch a representation for a W_3-string propagating in the background metric\nwith one flat direction by using a simple ansatz for the W-generators where\neach generator is a polynomial of the canonical currents and the veilbeins. In\nthe case of a general background we show that the simple polynomial ansatz\nfails, and terms containing the veilbein derivatives must be added.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jan 1996 12:24:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Dec 1996 12:56:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-01-16"}
