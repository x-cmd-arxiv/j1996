The improved model\nincludes premain sequence evolution, element diffusion, partial ionization\neffects, and all the possible nuclear reactions between the main elements. It\nuses updated values for the initial solar element abundances, the solar age,\nthe solar luminosity, the nuclear reaction rates and the radiative opacities.\nNeither nuclear equilibrium, nor complete ionization are assumed. The\ncalculated $^8$B solar neutrino flux is consistent, within the theoretical and\nexperimental uncertainties, with the solar neutrino flux measured by\nKamiokande. The results from the $^{37}$Cl and $^{71}$Ga radiochemical\nexperiments seem to suggest that the terrestrial $^7$Be solar neutrino flux is\nmuch smaller than that predicted. However, the present terrestrial ``defecit''\nof $^7$Be solar neutrinos may be due to the use of inaccurate theoretical\nneutrino absorption cross sections near threshold for extracting solar neutrino\nfluxes from production rates. Conclusive evidence for a real deficit of $^7$Be\nsolar neutrinos will require experiments such as BOREXINO or HELLAZ. A real\ndefecit of $^7$Be solar neutrinos can be due to either astrophysical reasons or\nneutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. Only future neutrino\nexperiments, such as SNO, Superkamiokande, BOREXINO and HELLAZ, will be able to\nprovide conclusive evidence that the solar neutrino problem is a consequence of\nneutrino properties beyond the standard electroweak model. Earlier indications\nmay be provided by long baseline neutrino oscillation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jan 1996 06:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
