The temperature $T$ of the photosphere decreases with distance\nfrom the black hole, and the outer surface is determined by the constraint\n$T\\sim m_{e}$ (for the QED case), since this is the point at which electrons\nand positrons annihilate, and the remaining photons free stream to infinity.\nObservational consequences are discussed, and it is found that, although the\nQED photosphere will not affect the Page-Hawking limits on primordial black\nholes, which is most important for 100MeV black holes, the inclusion of QCD\ninteractions may significantly effect this limit, since for QCD we estimate\n$T_{crit}\\sim \\Lambda_{QCD}$. The photosphere greatly reduces possibility of\nobserving individual black holes with temperatures greater than $T_{crit}$,\nsince the high energy particles emitted from the black hole are processed\nthrough the photosphere to a lower energy, where the gamma ray background is\nmuch higher. The temperature of the plasma in the photosphere can be extremely\nhigh, and this offers interesting possibilities for processes such as symmetry\nrestoration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 1996 17:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In other words, the stochastic branching process in molecular\ndynamics is formulated so that the instantaneous time evolution of the averaged\none-body distribution is essentially equivalent to the solution of Vlasov\nequation. Furthermore, as usual molecular dynamics, AMD-V keeps the many-body\ncorrelation and can naturally describe the fluctuation among many channels of\nthe reaction. It is demonstrated that the newly introduced process of AMD-V has\ndrastic effects in heavy ion collisions of 40Ca + 40Ca at 35 MeV/nucleon,\nespecially on the fragmentation mechanism, and AMD-V reproduces the\nfragmentation data very well.
