Keck\nTelescope of the high redshift z=1.824 aligned radio galaxy 3C256. Our\nobservations confirm that the spatially extended UV continuum emission from\nthis galaxy is polarized (P_V = 10.9% +/- 0.9%) with the electric vector\nperpendicular to the aligned radio and optical major axes (PA = 48.0 +/- 2.4\ndegrees). This strongly suggests that a significant fraction of the rest frame\nUV continuum emission from the galaxy is not starlight, but is instead\nscattered light from a powerful AGN which is hidden from our direct view. The\nnarrow emission lines, including MgII, are unpolarized. The percentage\npolarization of the continuum emission and the polarization position angle are\nroughly constant as a function of wavelength. The present data do not permit us\nto discriminate between cool electrons and dust as the origin of the\nscattering. But scattering by hot (T > 10^7 K) electrons cannot be the dominant\nprocess, since such a population would overproduce X-ray emission. A large\npopulation of cooler T ~ 10^4 K electrons could be responsible for both the\nline emission and the scattered light, but would require that the dust to gas\nratio in the scattering cones is 0.001 times smaller than that in our Galaxy\nand would imply that a large fraction of the baryonic mass in the galaxy is in\nthe ionized component of its ISM. Dust scattering is more efficient, but would\nresult in detectable extinction of the emission line spectrum unless the dust\ndistribution is more highly clumped than the line emitting gas. Finally, we\ndetect a strong (EW = 12A) broad (FWHM=6500 km/s) absorption line centered at\n1477A. We conclude that the most likely explanation is that the absorption is\ndue to a high velocity BAL cloud near the nucleus of 3C256.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jan 1996 02:02:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
