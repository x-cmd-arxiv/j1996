We\nquantify this evolution using the Press-Schechter formalism which we extend to\nflat models with a cosmological constant. Using new large N-body simulations,\nwe verify that this formalism accurately predicts the abundance of rich\nclusters as a function of redshift in various cosmologies. We normalise the\nmodels by comparing them to the local abundance of clusters as a function of\ntheir X-ray temperature which we rederive from data compiled by Henry & Arnaud.\nThis gives values of the rms density fluctuation in spheres of radius 8 Mpc/h\nof sigma_8 = (0.50+/- 0.04) Omega_0^{-0.47+0.10 Omega_0} if Lambda_0=0 and\nsigma_8 = (0.50 +/- 0.04) Omega_0^{-0.53+0.13 Omega_0} if Lambda_0=1-Omega_0.\nThese values depend very weakly on the shape of the power spectrum.

The splitting in the integrated counts is enhanced by the larger\nvolume element in low Omega_0 models.
