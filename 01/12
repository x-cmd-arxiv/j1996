The -1-brane\n(D-instanton) is a special object which, unlike all other Dirichlet-branes,\nexhibits point-like behavior. We find the R-R charged instanton solution to\ntype IIB supergravity and confirm that the field theoretic scattering off of\nthis solution miraculously reproduces the full stringy calculation. As an\naside, we include a discussion of the entropy of non-extremal black holes in\nten dimensions, produced by exciting the 0-brane. We show that, for large black\nholes, the entropy grows linearly with the black hole mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 1996 21:53:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Feb 1996 02:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Apr 1996 20:07:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
