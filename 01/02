We will describe a very simple version of chaotic inflation which\nleads to a division of the universe into infinitely many open universes with\nall possible values of Omega from 1 to 0. We will show also that in many\ninflationary models quantum fluctuations of scalar and vector fields produced\nduring reheating are much greater than they would be in a state of thermal\nequilibrium. This leads to cosmological phase transitions of a new type, which\nmay result in an efficient GUT baryogenesis, in a copious production of\ntopological defects and in a secondary stage of inflation after reheating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 1996 05:44:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The\navailability of near-infrared K-passband data made it possible for the first\ntime to trace fundamental parameters related to the luminous mass while hardly\nbeing hampered by the effects of dust and stellar populations. The observed\nnumber frequency of galaxies was corrected for selection effects to calculate\nvolume number densities of galaxies with respect to their fundamental\nparameters. The main conclusions of this investigation are:\n  1) Freeman's law has to be redefined. There is no single preferred value for\nthe central surface brightnesses of disks in galaxies. There is only an upper\nlimit to the central surface brightnesses of disks, while for lower central\nsurface brightnesses the number of galaxies per volume element decreases only\nslowly as function of the central surface brightness.\n  2) The Hubble sequence type index correlates strongly with the effective\nsurface brightness of the bulge, much better than with the bulge-to-disk ratio.\n  3) The disk and bulge scalelengths are correlated.\n  4) These scalelengths are not correlated with Hubble type. Hubble type is a\nlengthscale-free parameter and each type therefore comes in a range of\nmagnitudes (and presumably a range of total masses).\n  5) Low surface brightness spiral galaxies are not a separate class of\ngalaxies. In a number of aspects they are a continuation of a trend defined by\nthe high surface brightness galaxies. Low surface brightness galaxies are in\ngeneral of late Hubble type.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jan 1996 13:02:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-05-29"}
