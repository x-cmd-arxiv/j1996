It is\nshown that in singular gauge the sum of planar diagrams in leading order of the\n$1/N_{c}$ expansion provides similar results as the effective single-instanton\ncontribution. These effects are also analysed in regular gauge. Our findings\nconfirm that at large distances the correlator functions are more adequately\ndescribed in the singular gauge rather than in the regular one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jan 1996 13:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
