The `case I' DFs are anisotropic generalizations of the flattened\nf(E,L_z) model, which they include as a special case. The `case II' DFs\ngenerate flattened constant-anisotropy models, in which the constant ratio of\nrms tangential to radial motion is characterized by Binney's parameter beta.\nThe models can describe the outer parts of galaxies and the density cusp\nstructure near a central black hole, but also provide general insight into the\ndynamical properties of flattened systems.\n  The dependence of the intrinsic and projected properties on the model\nparameters and the inclination is described. The observed ratio of the rms\nprojected line-of-sight velocities on the projected major and minor axes of\nelliptical galaxies is best fit by the case II models with beta > 0. These\nmodels also predict non-Gaussian velocity profile shapes consistent with\nexisting observations.\n  The distribution functions are used to model the galaxies NGC 2434 (E1) and\nNGC 3706 (E4), for which stellar kinematical measurements out to two effective\nradii indicate the presence of dark halos (Carollo et al.). The velocity\nprofile shapes of both galaxies can be well fit by radially anisotropic case II\nmodels with a spherical logarithmic potential. This contrasts with the f(E,L_z)\nmodels studied previously, which require flattened dark halos to fit the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 1996 16:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

However, this\nseparation, as usually performed, introduces spurious large-distance effects\nthat produce an apparent breakdown of the important correspondence between\nstable particles and poles of the S-matrix, and, consequently, lead to apparent\nviolations of the correspondence principle and to incorrect results for\ncomputations in the mesoscopic domain lying between the atomic and classical\nregimes. An improved computational technique is described that allows valid\nresults to be obtained in this domain, and that leads, for the quantum\nremainder, in the cases studied, to a physical-region singularity structure\nthat, as regards the most singular parts, is the same as the normal\nphysical-region analytic structure in theories in which all particles have\nnon-zero mass. The key innovations are to define the classical part in\ncoordinate space, rather than in momentum space, and to define there a\nseparation of the photon-electron coupling into its classical and quantum parts\nthat has the following properties: 1) The contributions from the terms\ncontaining only classical couplings can be summed to all orders to give a\nunitary operator that generates the coherent state that corresponds to the\nappropriate classical process, and 2) The quantum remainder can be rigorously\nshown to exhibit, as regards its most singular parts, the normal analytic\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 1996 21:59:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
