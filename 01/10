Radio polarization studies reveal a net radial orientation of magnetic\nfields in the shell which cannot be explained by the simple compression either.\nWe model Rayleigh-Taylor instability at the interface of the ejecta and the\nshocked ambient medium to explain these observations.

Following a brief review of the Hermitian one\nmatrix model, the c=-2 matrix model is considered. Built from a matrix valued\nsuperfield this model displays supersymmetry on the matrix level. We stress the\nemergence of a Nicolai-map of this model to a free Hermitian matrix model and\nstudy its diagrammatic expansion in detail. Correlation functions for quartic\npotentials on arbitrary genus are computed, reproducing the string\nsusceptibility of c=-2 Liouville theory in the scaling limit. The results may\nbe used to perform a counting of supersymmetric graphs.\n  We then turn to the supereigenvalue model, today's only successful discrete\napproach to 2d quantum supergravity. The model is constructed in a\nsuperconformal field theory formulation by imposing the super-Virasoro\nconstraints. The complete solution of the model is given in the moment\ndescription, allowing the calculation of the free energy and the multi-loop\ncorrelators on arbitrary genus and for general potentials. The solution is\npresented in the discrete case and in the double scaling limit. Explicit\nresults up to genus two are stated.\n  Finally the supersymmetric generalization of the external field problem is\naddressed. We state the discrete super-Miwa transformations of the\nsupereigenvalue model on the eigenvalue and matrix level. Properties of\nexternal supereigenvalue models are discussed, although the model corresponding\nto the ordinary supereigenvalue model could not be identified so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jan 1996 14:39:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jan 1996 13:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Feb 1996 22:54:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Feb 1996 22:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
