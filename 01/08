The aim of this paper is to exhibit some simple models\nin which approximate decoherence arises as a result of local conservation. We\nderive a formula which shows the explicit connection between local conservation\nand approximate decoherence. We then consider a class of models consisting of a\nlarge number of weakly interacting components, in which the projections onto\nlocal densities may be decomposed into projections onto one of two alternatives\nof the individual components. The main example we consider is a one-dimensional\nchain of locally coupled spins, and the projections are onto the total spin in\na subsection of the chain. We compute the decoherence functional for histories\nof local densities, in the limit when the number of components is very large.\nWe find that decoherence requires two things: the smearing volumes must be\nsufficiently large to ensure approximate conservation, and the local densities\nmust be partitioned into sufficiently large ranges to ensure protection against\nquantum fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jan 1996 15:06:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Apr 1996 19:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}
