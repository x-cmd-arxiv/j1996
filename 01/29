A self-consistent calculation of the structure and the\nemerging spectrum of geometrically thin alpha-accretion disks in AGN is\npresented. The central object is assumed to be a Kerr black hole; full\nrelativistic corrections are included. The local dissipation of gravitational\nenergy is assumed to be entirely due to turbulence. Since these disks are\nmainly supported by radiation pressure, the assumption that the viscous energy\nproduction is proportional to the total pressure leads to diverging temperature\nstructures in the upper parts of the disk, where the total optical depths is\nsmall. We therefore modify the standard expression for the turbulent viscosity\nby taking into account the radiative energy loss of turbulent elements in an\noptically thin regime. Compton scattering is treated in the Fokker-Planck\napproximation using the Kompaneets oparator. The absorption cross section\ncontains only free-free processes for a pure hydrogen atmosphere. We present\nseveral calculations for various parameters such as the accretion rate, the\nviscosity parameter, the specific angular momentum of the black hole and the\ninclination angle of the observer. The resulting temperature and density\nprofiles show that the disks are optically thick for Compton scattering and\neffectively optically thin for most frequencies. This leads to spectra that are\ndiluted with respect to the photon number but contain a Comptonized high energy\ntail in order to carry the required energy flux. In addition the electron\ntemperature deviates strongly from the equilibrium temperature. Therefore, the\nmodel can in general account for the observed soft X--ray excess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jan 1996 11:10:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Feb 1996 10:07:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2012-07-02"}
