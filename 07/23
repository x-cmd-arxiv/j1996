While both an open universe, and a universe\nwith a cosmological constant alleviate this problem, I argue here that this\nresult favors a non-zero cosmological constant, especially when considered in\nlight of other cosmological constraints. In the first place, for the favored\nrange of matter densities, this constraint is more stringent than the globular\ncluster age constraint, which already favors a non-zero cosmological constant.\nMoreover, the age-redshift relation for redshifts of order unity implies that\nthe ratio between the age associated with redshift 1.55 and the present age is\nalso generally larger for a cosmological constant dominated universe than for\nan open universe. In addition, structure formation is generally suppressed in\nlow density cosmologies, arguing against early galaxy formation. The additional\nconstraints imposed by the new observation on the parameter space of $h$ vs\n$\\Omega_{matter}$ (where $H= 100 h kms^{-1}Mpc^{-1}$) are derived for both\ncosmologies.
