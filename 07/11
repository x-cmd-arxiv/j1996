Through the success of these comparisons we\nhave demonstrated that our {diffusion-convection} method and injection\ntechniques provide a practical tool to capture essential physics of the\ninjection process and particle acceleration at oblique MHD shocks. In addition\nto the diffusion-convection simulations, we have included time dependent\ntwo-fluid simulations for a couple of the shocks to demonstrate the basic\nvalidity of that formalism in the oblique shock context. Using simple models\nfor the two-fluid closure parameters based on test-particle considerations, we\nfind good agreement with the dynamical properties of the more detailed\ndiffusion-convection results. We emphasize, however, that such two-fluid\nresults can be sensitive to the properties of these closure parameters when the\nflows are not truly steady. Furthermore, we emphasize through example how the\nvalidity of the two-fluid formalism does not necessarily mean that {\\it\nsteady-state} two-fluid models provide a reliable tool for predicting the\nefficiency of particle acceleration in real shocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 1996 20:14:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

This parameter is found to lie in a very narrow range, due\nto global disc-jets constraints. This investigation provided two important\nresults. First, the disc vertical equilibrium imposes a minimum mass flux\nejected. Second, their asymptotic behaviour critically depends on a fastness\nparameter $\\omega_A= \\Omega_*r_A /V_{Ap,A}$, ratio of the field lines rotation\nvelocity to the poloidal Alfv\\'en velocity at the Alfv\\'en surface. This\nparameter must be bigger than, but of the order of, unity. Self-similar jets\nfrom Keplerian discs, after widening up to a maximum radius whose value\nincreases with $\\omega_A$, always recollimate towards the jet axis, until the\nfast-magnetosonic critical point is reached. It is doubtful that such solutions\ncould steadily cross this last point, the jet either ending there or\nrebouncing. Recollimation takes place because of the increasing effect of\nmagnetic constriction. This systematic behaviour is due to the large opening of\nthe magnetic surfaces, leading to such an efficient acceleration that matter\nalways reaches its maximum poloidal velocity. This ``over-widening'' stems from\nhaving the same ejection efficiency $\\xi$ in the whole jet. Realistic jets, fed\nwith ejection indices varying from one magnetic surface to the other, would not\nundergo recollimation, allowing either cylindrical or parabolic asymptotic\ncollimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 1996 12:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Supervised learning approaches are\nuseful when a tagged corpus is available as an example of the desired output of\nthe tagger. Based on such a corpus, the tagger-generator automatically builds a\ntagger which is able to tag new text the same way, diminishing development time\nfor the construction of a tagger considerably. Memory-based tagging shares this\nadvantage with other statistical or machine learning approaches. Additional\nadvantages specific to a memory-based approach include (i) the relatively small\ntagged corpus size sufficient for training, (ii) incremental learning, (iii)\nexplanation capabilities, (iv) flexible integration of information in case\nrepresentations, (v) its non-parametric nature, (vi) reasonably good results on\nunknown words without morphological analysis, and (vii) fast learning and\ntagging.

We find that the correlation is quasilinear and\nrobust with respect to the differencies both between initial and final-state\ncalculations of the SCLS's and two distinct measures of the SDBS's. We show\nthat despite the complex spatial dependence of the surface potential shift\n(SPS) and the location of the 3d and 4d orbitals in different regions of space,\nthe correlation exists because the sampling of the SPS by the 3d and 4d\norbitals remains similar. We show further that the sign change of the SCLS's\nacross the transition series does indeed arise from the d band-narrowing\nmechanism previously proposed. However, while in the heavier transition metals\nthe predicted increase of d electrons in the surface layer relative to the bulk\narises primarily from transfers from s and p states to d states within the\nsurface layer, in the lighter transition metals the predicted decrease of\nsurface d electrons arises primarily from flow out into the vacuum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 1996 17:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
