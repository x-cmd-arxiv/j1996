The three statistical techniques applied to the two\nversions of the data set result in time delay values in the range 398 to 461\ndays (or 1.09 to 1.26 years, A leading B), each with ~5% formal uncertainty.\nThe corresponding flux ratios (B/A) are in the range 0.698 to 0.704. Thus, the\nnew features in the light curve show that the time delay is less than 500 days,\nin contrast with analysis of earlier versions of the radio light curves.
