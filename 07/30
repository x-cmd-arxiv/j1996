The mean rate of such life devastating CRBs is\none in 100 million years (Myr), consistent with the observed 5 ``great''\nextinctions in the past 600 Myr. Unlike the previously suggested\nextraterrestrial extinction mechanisms the CRBs explain massive life extinction\non the ground, underground and underwater and the higher survival levels of\nradiation resistant species and of terrain sheltered species. More distant\nmergers can cause smaller extinctions. Biological mutations caused by ionizing\nradiation produced by the CRB may explain a fast appearance of new species\nafter mass extinctions.

Using\nvarious bosonization techniques, the fixed point is shown to be {\\em stable}.\nHowever, unlike the conventional two-channel Kondo (2CK) model, it has {\\em\nfour} leading irrelevant operators, implying that while the form of the\nsingular temperature dependence of physical quantities is similar to the 2CK\nmodel, there will not be simple universal amplitude ratios. The phase diagram\nof this system is analyzed and a critical manifold is found to separate the\nnon-Fermi-liquid from a conventional Fermi liquid fixed point. Generalization\nto higher symmetries, such as cubic, and the possibility of physical\nrealizations with dynamic Jahn-Teller impurities is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 1996 23:59:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Any classical algorithm to do this will need at\nleast O(1/epsilon^2) samples. Quantum mechanical systems can simultaneously\ncarry out multiple computations due to their wave like properties. This paper\ndescribes an O(1/epsilon) step algorithm for the above estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 1996 19:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

By\ninserting such a complete, composite expression of the velocity into the\nkinetic energy term of the non-relativistic classical (i.e., newtonian)\nlagrangian, we straightforwardly get the appearance of the so-called \"quantum\npotential\" associated, as it is known, with the Madelung fluid. This result\ncarries further evidence that the quantum behaviour of micro-systems can be\nadirect consequence of the fundamental existence of spin. In the second part\n(Sections 3 and 4), we fix our attention on the total 3-velocity v = w + V, it\nbeing now necessary to pass to relativistic (classical) physics; and we show\nthat the proper time entering the definition of the four-velocity v^mu for\nspinning particles has to be the proper time tau of the CM frame. Inserting the\ncorrect Lorentz factor into the definition of v^mu leads to completely new\nkinematical properties for v_mu v^mu. The important constraint p_mu v^mu = m,\nidentically true for scalar particles, but just assumed a priori in all\nprevious spinning particle theories, is herein derived in a self-consistent\nway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 1996 04:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2010-03-04"}
