Previous work demonstrated that tidal\nheating is effective well inside the impulse approximation limit. Not only does\nthe overall energy increase over previous predictions, but the work is done\ndeep inside the secondary galaxy, e.g. at or inside the half mass radius in\nmost cases. Here, these ideas applied to cannibalization of elliptical galaxies\nwith fundamental-plane parameters. In summary, satellites which can fall to the\ncenter of a cluster giant by dynamical friction are evaporated by internal\nheating by the time they reach the center. This suggests that true\nmerger-produced multiple nuclei giants should be rare. Specifically,\nsecondaries with mass ratios as small as 1\\% on any initial orbit evaporate and\nthose on eccentric orbits with mass ratios as small as 0.1\\% evolve\nsignificantly and nearly evaporate in a galaxian age. Captured satellites with\nmass ratios smaller than roughly 1\\% have insufficient time to decay to the\ncenter. After many accretion events, the model predicts that the merged system\nhas a profile similar to that of the original primary with a weak increase in\nconcentration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 1996 18:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
