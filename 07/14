Using this we consider the standard hierarchy of\nequations relating the $n$-th order correlations (originating from the viscous\nterm in the NS eq.) to $n+1$'th order (originating from the nonlinear term) and\ndemonstrate that for fully unfused correlations the viscous term is negligible.\nConsequently the hierarchic chain is decoupled in the sense that the\ncorrelations of $n+1$'th order satisfy a homogeneous equation that may exhibit\nanomalous scaling solutions. Using the same hierarchy of eqs. when some\nseparations go to zero we derive a second set of fusion rules for correlations\nwith differences in the viscous range. The latter includes gradient fields. We\ndemonstrate that every n'th order correlation function of velocity differences\n${\\cal F}_n(\\B.R_1,\\B.R_2,\\dots)$ exhibits its own cross-over length $\\eta_{n}$\nto dissipative behavior as a function of, say, $R_1$. This length depends on\n$n$ {and on the remaining separations} $R_2,R_3,\\dots$. When all these\nseparations are of the same order $R$ this length scales like $\\eta_n(R)\\sim\n\\eta (R/L)^{x_n}$ with $x_n=(\\zeta_n-\\zeta_{n+1}+\\zeta_3-\\zeta_2)/(2-\\zeta_2)$,\nwith $\\zeta_n$ being the scaling exponent of the $n$'th order structure\nfunction. We derive a class of exact scaling relations bridging the exponents\nof correlations of gradient fields to the exponents $\\zeta_n$ of the $n$'th\norder structure functions. One of these relations is the well known ``bridge\nrelation\" for the scaling exponent of dissipation fluctuations $\\mu=2-\\zeta_6$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 1996 09:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
