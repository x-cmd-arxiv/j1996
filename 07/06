Using self-consistent models of X-ray clusters in the context of\nhierarchical models of structure formation, we show that both the mean Compton\n{\\it y} parameter and the number of clusters observed via the SZ effect\nstrongly depend on $\\Omega_{o}$. These quantities are higher in open\ncosmological models due to the earlier epoch of structure formation.\nSpecifically, we compare two models which are able to reproduce the present\nabundance of X-ray clusters, one for $\\Omega_{o}=0.2$ and the other $\\Omega =\n1$. For $\\Omega_{o}=0.2$, ${\\ymean}$ exceeds the current FIRAS limit of\n$1.5\\times10^{-5}$. Also, the SZ redshift source distribution considerably\ndiffers in the two cosmological models. Thus, these results show that both an\nimprovement in our knowledge of CMB spectral distortions and the realization of\nmillimeter surveys to look for SZ sources over a large area of the sky should\nproduce interesting constraints on $\\Omega_{o}$ and on the evolution of the\nbaryonic fractionof virialized structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jul 1996 17:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}
