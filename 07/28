These\nhigher cross sections lead to higher muon rates for arrival angles where\nneutrino attenuation in the earth is less important. On the other hand, new\nestimates of AGN neutrino fluxes suggest that the expected muon rates in these\ndetectors may be much lower than previously calculated. I use the new cross\nsections to calculate the expected muon rates and angular distributions in\nlarge detectors for a variety of AGN models and compare these rates with the\natmospheric neutrino backrounds (from both conventional decay channels and the\n\"prompt\" charmed meson decay channels). If the lowest flux estimates are\ncorrect, there may be diffculties in determining the origin of a small excess\nof muons, due to the large uncertainty in the rate of the charmed meson\nneutrino production channel.

Their development proceeds in three phases. In the first phase, weak\nmagnetic fields are created by the Biermann battery mechanism, acting in\nshocked parts of the intergalactic medium where caustics form and intersect. In\nthe second phase, these weak magnetic fields are amplified to strong magnetic\nfields by the Kolmogoroff turbulence endemic to gravitational structure\nformation of galaxies. During this second phase, the magnetic fields reach\nsaturation with the turbulent power, but they are coherent only on the scale of\nthe smallest eddy. In the third phase, the magnetic field strength increases to\nequipartition with the turbulent energy, and the coherence length of the\nmagnetic fields increases to the scale of the largest turbulent eddy,\ncomparable to the scale of the entire galaxy. The resulting magnetic field\nrepresents a galactic magnetic field of primordial origin. No further dynamo\naction is necessary, after the galaxy forms, to explain the origin of magnetic\nfields. However, the magnetic field may be altered by dynamo action once the\ngalaxy and the galactic disk have formed.
