Our emphasis here is more on the `bottom-up' approach, where one\nstarts with the semiclassical theory of gravity and examines how it is modified\nby graviton and quantum field excitations near and above the Planck scale. We\nmention three aspects based on our recent findings: 1) Emergence of stochastic\nbehavior of spacetime and matter fields depicted by an Einstein-Langevin\nequation. The backreaction of quantum fields on the classical background\nspacetime manifests as a fluctuation-dissipation relation. 2) Manifestation of\nstochastic behavior in effective theories below the threshold arising from\nexcitations above. The implication for general relativity is that such\nPlanckian effects, though exponentially suppressed, is in principle detectable\nat sub-Planckian energies. 3) Decoherence of correlation histories and quantum\nto classical transition. From Gell-Mann and Hartle's observation that the\nhydrodynamic variables which obey conservation laws are most readily decohered,\none can, in the spirit of Wheeler, view the conserved Bianchi identity obeyed\nby the Einstein tensor as an indication that general relativity is a\nhydrodynamic theory of geometry.
