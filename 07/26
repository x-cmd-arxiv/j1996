The form of the dispersion relation is the same for all equations\nof state considered, for all magnetic field strengths, and for both geometries\nexamined. We demonstrate the existence of a fastest growing mode for the system\nand study how its characteristics depend on the amount of turbulence and the\nstrength of the magnetic field. Generally, turbulence tends to increase the\nrate and the length scale of fragmentation. While tending to slow the\nfragmentation, the magnetic field has little effect on the fragmentation length\nscale until reaching some threshold, above which the length scale decreases\nsignificantly.

Comparisons are made with previous simulations of jets through\nhomogeneous media. We find that for radiative cooling jets propagating into\nregions where the ambient medium has an increasing density (and pressure)\ngradient, the ambient gas tends to compress the cold, low-pressure cocoon of\nshocked material that surrounds the beam and destroy the bow shock-like\nstructure at the head. The compressing medium collimates the jet and promotes\nthe development of Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities which cause beam focusing,\nwiggling and the formation of internal traveling shocks, $close$ $to$ $the$\n$head$, via pinching along the beam. This remarkably resembles the structure of\nsome observed systems (e.g. Haro 6-5B northern and HH 24G jets). These effects\nare larger for jets with smaller density ratio between jet and environment\n$\\eta $ (tested for $\\eta $=1, 3, and 10) and larger Mach number $M_a=v_j/c_a$\n(tested for $M_a=$12 and 24, where $v_j$ is the jet velocity and $c_a$ the\nambient sound speed). In an ambient medium of decreasing density (and\npressure), the beam is poorly collimated and relaxes, becoming faint. This\ncould explain ''invisible'' jet sections, like the gap between the parent\nsource and collimated beam (e.g., in HH30 jet). Although, on average, jets\npropagating into an increasing (decreasing) density environment are decelerated\n(accelerated) by the increasing (decreasing) ram pressure of the ambient\nmedium, we find that their propagation velocities have an oscillating pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 1996 20:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
