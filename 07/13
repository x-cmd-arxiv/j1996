For the N=1 type I model\nrecently obtained from the type IIB string on the Z orbifold, we identify the\nK\\\"ahler manifold of the untwisted scalars in the unoriented closed sector with\nthe generalized Siegel upper-half plane Sp(8,R)/(SU(4) \\times U(1)). The SU(4)\nfactor reflects the holonomy group of Calabi-Yau fourfolds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jul 1996 14:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-18"}

It is argued that chiral perturbation theory\ncannot yield a prediction for the strangeness radius and magnetic moment.\nArrival at definite predictions requires the introduction of additional,\nmodel-dependent assumptions which go beyond the framework of chiral\nperturbation theory. A variety of such model predictions is surveyed, and the\ncredibility of each is evaluated. The most plausible prediction appears in a\nmodel where the unknown chiral counterterms are identified with $t$-channel\nvector meson exchange amplitudes.
