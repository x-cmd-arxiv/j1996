In this paper, we compute the quenched average dimensions, which are\nexpected to apply to typical members of the ensemble. We develop a perturbative\nexpansion for the average of the logarithm of the multifractal partition\nfunction; the leading and sub-leading divergent terms in this expansion are\nthen resummed to all orders. The result is that in the limit where the number\nof particles n -> \\infty, the quenched and annealed dimensions are {\\it\nidentical}; however, the attainment of this limit requires enormous values of\nn. At smaller, more realistic values of n, the apparent quenched dimensions\ndiffer from the annealed dimensions. We interpret these results to mean that\nwhile multifractality as an ensemble property of random branched growth (and\nhence of DLA) is quite robust, it subtly fails for typical members of the\nensemble.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 1996 15:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

I investigate how low energy dynamical SUSY\nbreaking may arise from superstring models.

Due to the small gauge\ncontent of the hidden gauge group the supersymmetry breaking scale may be\nconsistent with the dynamical SUSY breaking scenarios. The messenger states are\nobtained in the superstring model from sectors which arise due to the\n``Wilson--line'' breaking of the unifying non--Abelian gauge symmetry. An\nimportant property of the string motivated messenger states is the absence of\nsuperpotential terms with the Standard Model states.
