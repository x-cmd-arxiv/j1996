The main interest in the investigation is\nconcentrated on the beam stability in an active cooling system. A stochastic\ncooling system must be considered as a closed-loop, similar to the feedback\nsystems used to damp collective instabilities. These systems, which are able to\nact upon themselves, are potentially unstable.\n  The self-consistent solution for the beam motion is derived by means of a\nmode analysis of the collective beam motion. This solution yields a criterion\nfor the stability of each collective mode. The expressions also allow for\noverlapping frequency bands in the beam spectrum and thus are valid over the\nentire frequency range.\n  Having established the boundaries of stability in this way, the Fokker-Planck\nequation is used to describe the cooling process. This description does not\ninclude collective effects and thus a stable beam must be assumed. Hence the\npredictions about the cooling process following from the Fokker-Planck equation\nonly make physical sense within the boundaries of beam stability. Finally it is\nverified that the parameters of the cooling system which give the best cooling\nresults are compatible with the stability of the beam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 1996 14:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In the limit of small $\\gamma_e$, the density jump at shocks is\nshown to be of the order of $e^{M^2}$. Without self-gravity, the density\nstructures arising in the moderately compressible case consist mostly of\npatches separated by shocks and behaving like waves, while in the highly\ncompressible case clearly defined long-lived object-like clouds emerge. When\nthe forcing in the momentum equation is purely compressible, the rotational\nenergy decays monotonically in time, indicating that the vortex-stretching term\nis not efficient in transferring energy to rotational modes. This property may\nbe at the origin of the low amount of rotation found in interstellar clouds.\nVorticity production is found to rely heavily on the presence of additional\nterms in the equations. In the presence of self-gravity, we suggest that\nturbulence can produce bound structures for $\\gamma_e < 2(1-1/n)$, where $n$ is\nthe typical dimensionality of the turbulent compressions. We support this\nresult by means of numerical simulations in which, for sufficiently small\n$\\gamma_e$, small-scale turbulent density fluctuations eventually collapse even\nthough the medium is globally stable. This result is preserved in the presence\nof a magnetic field for supercritical mass-to-flux ratios. At larger polytropic\nexponents, turbulence alone is not capable of producing bound structures, and\ncollapse can only occur when the medium is globally unstable. This mechanism is\na plausible candidate for the differentiation between primordial and\npresent-day stellar-cluster formation and for the low efficiency of star\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jul 1996 15:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
