One can remove these divergences by introducing counterterms. To do\nthis without changing the model, one has to solve an inversion equation. We\ncall this procedure Fermi surface renormalization (FSR). Whether or not FSR is\npossible depends on the regularity properties of the fermion self--energy. When\nthe Fermi surface is nonspherical, this regularity problem is rather\nnontrivial. Using improved power counting at all orders in perturbation theory,\nwe have shown sufficient differentiability to solve the FSR equation for a\nclass of models with a non-nested, non-spherical Fermi surface. I will first\nmotivate the problem and give a definition of FSR, and then describe the\ncombination of geometric and graphical facts that lead to the improved power\ncounting bounds. These bounds also apply to the four--point function. They\nimply that only ladder diagrams can give singular contributions to the\nfour--point function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 1996 17:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

In the framework of the lattice\nmodel we build a database of model proteins by a) picking randomly 200 lattice\nchain conformations; b) designing sequences which fold into these structures\nwith some arbitrary ``true'' potential; c) use this database for extracting a\npotential; d) fold model proteins using the extracted potential.
