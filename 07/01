For\nTp > 300 MeV there is much less difference between optical models, but the\ncalculations substantially underpredict transparency data and the discrepancy\nincreases with A. The differences between Glauber and optical model\ncalculations are related to their respective definitions of the semi-inclusive\ncross section.
