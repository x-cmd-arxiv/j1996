A general low-energy Lagrangian is\nconstrained by a minimum cross section times branching ratio into two electrons\nand two photons, kinematics consistent with the event, and LEP1-LEP130 data. We\nexamine how the supersymmetric parameters depend on the kinematics, branching\nratios and experimental predictions with a selectron interpretation of the\nevent, and discuss to what extent these are modified by other interpretations.\nPredictions for imminent CERN LEP upgrades and the present and future Fermilab\nTevatron are presented. Finally, we briefly discuss the possible connection to\nother phenomena including a light stop, the neutralino relic density, the shift\nin $R_b$ and the associated shift in $\\alpha_s$, and implications for the form\nof the theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 1996 04:59:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Nov 1996 23:22:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
