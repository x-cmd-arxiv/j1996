We investigate the kinematic limits\non the source size due to the observed time structure in three types of bursts:\nshort spikes, FREDs (Fast Rise, Exponentail decay), and long complex bursts.\nThe emitting shell keeps up with the photons it produces reducing apparent\ndurations by $\\Gamma^2$ so that source sizes can be very large ($2c\\Gamma^2\nT_{dur}). However, the thickness of the emitting region is not effected by the\nshell motion so it must always be small, $c\\Delta T$ where $\\Delta T$ is the\nsubpeak time scale. We argue that one can only view the bulk motion head-on so\nit is inappropriate to treat GRBs as viewing the sides of a jet. Although\nphotons come from a region within an angle $\\Gamma^{-1}$, we show that the\ncurvature of the shell within that angle creates delays comparable to those\nassociated with the duration of the event. As a result, most bursts should be\nlike FREDs with sharp rises related to how long the shell emits and power law\ndecays related to how long the shell expanded before becoming gamma-ray active.\nFew bursts have the long decay phases required for large shells resulting in\nunacceptable high densities for ISM objects to cause the observed subpeaks. To\nbe consistent with the observations, perhaps very thick shells (which act as\nparallel slabs) are required to avoid the effects of the curvature, or the\nduration is dictated by a central engine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jul 1996 18:32:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

In addition to determining\nthe reddening toward these two clusters, it is shown that starcounts at\nintermediate Galactic latitudes in the range 11< V< 17 allow us to constrain\nthe model scale-height for disk subgiants. We obtain a mean value of 250 +/- 32\npc, in agreement with previous determinations of the scale-height for\nred-giants. We are also able to constrain the scale-height of main-sequence\nstars, and the distance of the sun from the Galactic plane, ruling out the\npossibility of a value of +40 pc, in favor of a smaller value. Comparisons with\nthe observed proper-motion histograms indicate that the velocity dispersion of\ndisk main-sequence stars must increase with distance from the Galactic plane in\norder to match the observed proper-motion dispersion. The required increase is\nconsistent with the values predicted by dynamical models, and provides a clear\nobservational evidence in favor of such gradients. The shape of the observed\nproper-motion distribution is well fitted within the Poisson uncertainties.\nThis implies that corrections to absolute proper motion (and, therefore, space\nvelocities) for open clusters may be obtained using our model when no inertial\nreference frame is available.

We derive propagation equations in space and time\nfor the quantized radiation field including the effects of linear absorption\nand dispersion as well as nonlinear optical effects. As a special case we\nderive the propagation equation of a narrow-frequency band light pulse in a\nKerr medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 1996 15:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
