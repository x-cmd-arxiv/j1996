We derive several expressions for these mass multipole moments\nin terms of the shear, which allow large flexibility in the choice of a radial\nweight function. In contrast to determining multipole moments from weak-lensing\nmass reconstructions, this approach allows to quantify the signal-to-noise\nratio of the multipole moments directly from the observed galaxy ellipticities,\nand thus to estimate the significance of the multipole detection. Radial weight\nfunctions can therefore be chosen such as to optimize the significance of the\ndetection given an assumed radial mass profile.
