However, locality is supposed to be broken only in\nthe mild way that all the non-local influence comes from integrals over the\nwhole of space-time and acts at all moments and all places with the same\neffect. Thus the observable effects of the lack of locality can only be seen in\nthe constants of Nature. Our cleanest prediction is the Higgs boson mass being\n149 +/- 26 GeV, which in addition assumes that the pure Standard Model is valid\nuntil the Planck scale. Adding the assumption that the two vacuum states needed\nin our model come about naturally requires a strong first order transition\nbetween them; together with the assumption of the Planck units being\nfundamental, this leads us to also predict the top quark mass as 173 +/- 5 GeV,\nand a more precise value of the Higgs boson mass as 135 +/- 9 GeV. With the\nassumption of the anti-grand unified group SMG x SMG x SMG (three copies of the\nStandard Model gauge group, one for each generation), it is also possible to\nsuccessfully predict the three fine structure constants in the Standard Model.\nWe also discuss the extension of the SMG x SMG x SMG group by an extra abelian\nfactor U(1)_f and the fermion mass matrices in this model. Other vacua than the\npresent one might appear in the future due to human activity. The breaking of\nlocality is really of the same mild character as suggested by baby universe\ntheory, so the present work may be considered as a development of baby universe\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 1996 13:42:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
