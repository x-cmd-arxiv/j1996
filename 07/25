The breakup is treated in the eikonal approximation with a profile\nfunction calculated from a realistic optical potential at low energies and from\nfree nucleon-nucleon cross sections at high energies. This treatment gives a\ngood description of measured breakup cross sections, as well as the\nlongitudinal momentum distribution of the core-like fragments, which is\nnarrower than predicted in the transparent limit. The real part of the\npotential is found to be significant and enhances the diffractive breakup at\nlow energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 1996 21:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

An experimental setup is presented which can measure\nthe density matrix (or equivalently, the Wigner function) of a beam of\nidentically prepared charged particles to an arbitrary accuracy, limited only\nby count statistics and detector resolution. The particles enter into an\nelectric field causing simple harmonic oscillation in the transverse direction.\nThis corresponds to rotating the Wigner function in phase space. With a\nslidable detector, the marginal distribution of the Wigner function can be\nmeasured from all angles. Thus the phase-space tomography formalism can be used\nto recover the Wigner function by the standard inversion of the Radon\ntransform. By applying this technique to for instance double-slit experiments\nwith various degrees of environment-induced decoherence, it should be possible\nto make our understanding of decoherence and apparent wave-function collapse\nless qualitative and more quantitative.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jul 1996 07:52:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
