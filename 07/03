The ASCA SIS detectors allow a more detailed study of the iron K\ncomplex than has been possible before. We find that prior to a sudden upward\nflux transition the dominant iron K feature appears to consist of a large edge\nfrom neutral or nearly-neutral iron. The depth of the edge corresponds to an\nabsorption column of about 1.5E24 cm^{-2}, while little absorption over that\nexpected from the Galaxy is seen at lower X-ray energies. The differential\nabsorption at high and low X-ray energies combined with the iron edge energy\nare strong evidence that partial covering is a crucial determinant of the\nbehaviour observed from Cir X-1. The continuum spectral variability observed by\nASCA can also be understood naturally in terms of partial covering column\nchanges. There is evidence for a relatively weak emission line from neutral\niron with an equivalent width of only about 65 eV. After the flux transition,\nthe strength of the edge feature is greatly reduced, suggesting a large\nreduction in the amount of partial covering. For a large region of\nstatistically acceptable chi-squared parameter space, the luminosity of Cir\nX-1, after correction for partial covering, need not change during the\ntransition.

The frame adapted to pseudomomentum has\nin general a nonvanishing velocity with respect to the frames where the field\nis purely magnetic. This velocity plays a crucial role in the occurance of\nmotional terms; these terms are taken into account within a manifestly\ncovariant framework. Perturbation theory is available when the mutual\ninteraction doesnot depend on the total energy; a weak-field-slow-motion\napproximation is more specially tractable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 1996 14:40:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Jan 1998 16:38:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

In the process a factorization theorem is proved\nfor Wilson lines. Wilson lines are then closed back into Wilson loops and new\nlink invariants of finite type are defined.

Transverse expansion leads to a strong shoulder-arm shape\nand different inverse slope parameters in the transverse spectra of nuclear\nclusters deviating markedly from thermal distributions. A clear ``bounce-off''\nevent shape is seen: the averaged transverse flow velocities in the reaction\nplane are for clusters larger than for protons. The cluster yields\n--particularly at low $p_t$ at midrapidities-- and the in-plane (anti)flow of\nclusters and pions change if suitably strong baryon potential interactions are\nincluded.
