It is the nearest large galaxy, it probably has its own dark\nhalo, and its tilted position with respect to the line of sight provides an\nunmistakable signature of microlensing. However most stars of M31 are not\nresolved and one has to use the ``pixel method'': monitor the pixels of the\nimage rather than the stars. AGAPE is the implementation of this idea. Data\nhave been collected and treated during two autumns of observation at the 2\nmetre telescope of Pic du Midi. The process of geometric and photometric\nalignment, which must be performed before constructing pixel light curves, is\ndescribed. Seeing variations are minimised by working with large super-pixels\n(2.1) compared with the average seeing. A high level of stability of pixel\nfluxes, crucial to the approach, is reached. Fluctuations of super-pixels do\nnot exceed 1.7 times the photon noise which is 0.1% of the intensity for the\nbrightest ones. With such stable data, 10 microlensing events are expected for\na full ``standard halo''. With a larger field, a regular and short time\nsampling and a long lever arm in time, the pixel method will be a very\nefficient tool to explore the halo of M31.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jul 1996 18:55:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Dec 1996 17:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-05-23"}

The 2D Ising model\npartition function $Q$ is presentable as the fermionic Gaussian integral. The\nuse of the spin-polynomial interpretation of the 2D Ising problem is stressed,\nin particular. Starting with the spin-polynomial interpretation of the local\nBoltzmann weights, the Gaussian integral for $Q$ appears in the universal form\nfor a variety of lattices, including the standard rectangular, triangular, and\nhexagonal lattices, and with the minimal number of fermionic variables (two per\nsite). The analytic solutions for the correspondent 2D Ising models then follow\nby passing to the momentum space on a lattice. The symmetries and the question\non the location of critical point have an interesting interpretation within\nthis spin-polynomial formulation of the problem. From the exact lattice theory\nwe then pass to the continuum-limit field-theoretical interpretation of the 2D\nIsing models. The continuum theory captures all relevant features of the\noriginal models near $T_c$. The continuum limit corresponds to the low-momentum\nsector of the exact theory responsible for the critical-point singularities and\nthe large-distance behaviour of correlations. The resulting field theory is the\nmassive two-component Majorana theory, with mass vanishing at $T_c$. By\ndoubling of fermions in the Majorana representation, we obtain as well the 2D\nDirac field theory of charged fermions for 2D Ising models. The differences\nbetween particular 2D Ising lattices are merely adsorbed, in the\nfield-theoretical formulation, in the definition of the effective mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jul 1996 14:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Aug 1997 21:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
