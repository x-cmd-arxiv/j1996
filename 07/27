These cases correspond to similar regimes considered in previous works\naddressing the Ostwald ripening of ensembles of features. A third possible\nlimiting case is noted for the special geometry of \"stacked\" islands. In these\nlimiting cases, isolated features are predicted to decay in size with a power\nlaw scaling in time: A is proportional to (t0-t)^n, where A is the area of the\nfeature, t0 is the time at which the feature disappears, and n=2/3 or 1.

We first compare various methods of obtaining\na low-energy expression based either on the soft-photon approximation or the\nuse of Ward-Takahashi identities. We point out that structure-dependent terms\nare defined with respect to a low-energy approximation of the pole terms which\ncommonly is separated from the full amplitude. We derive a general expression\nfor the structure-dependent terms in an expansion in terms of the momenta $k_1$\nand $k_2$ of the initial and final virtual photon, respectively, up to and\nincluding terms of order ${\\cal O}(k^4)$. At order ${\\cal O}(k^2)$ two terms\nappear which are related to the usual electric and magnetic polarizabilities of\nreal Compton scattering. At order ${\\cal O}(k^4)$ we find nine new structures\nof which five can only be determined using virtual photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jul 1996 21:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
