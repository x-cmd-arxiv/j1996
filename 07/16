Our results allow us to give a first characterization of deformed\nstates for such films. We resolve the kinetic and the dynamic stage of the\ndeformation process in time and access the length scale between discrete\nparticle and continuum mechanics behaviour. For the chainlengths considered\nhere, we find that the deformation process is dominated by shear. We observe\nstrangling effects for the film and deformation fluctuations in the steady\nstate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 1996 14:23:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-25"}

The phases to which physical significance is ascribed are\nnormally regarded as artifacts of a regulation procedure. In the context of a\nY-M lattice gauge theory, the MPCP is applied to the system of different\n(Planck scale) lattice phases that can be provoked using a suitably generalised\naction with a gauge group that is taken to be the Planck scale predecessor to\nthe Standard Model Group (SMG) - namely the $N_{gen}$-fold Cartesian product of\nthe SMG. Here $N_{gen}$ is the number of fermion generations. Ambiguities under\nmappings of the gauge group $SGM^{N_{gen}}$ onto itself result in the Planck\nscale breakdown to the diagonal subgroup which is isomorphic to the usual SMG.\nAssuming the validity of the MPCP, the three SMG gauge couplings at the Planck\nscale are predicted to be equal to the diagonal subgroup couplings correspond-\ning to the multiple point action parameters in a lattice gauge theory with the\ngauge group $SMG^{N_{gen}}$. This prediction gives agreement with experiment to\nwithin 10 \\% for the non-Abelian couplings and 5\\% for the U(1) gauge coup-\nling. In a more general context, the MPCP is proposed as a fundamental princi-\nple of Nature that can also explain other fine-tuning enigma in high energy\nphysics. It is argued that the MPCP implies having long range nonlocal inter-\nactions which are identical between fields at all pairs of spacetime points.\nSuch interactions are allowed in a very general form of a reparameterization\ninvariant action. This phenomenologically unobjectionable form of nonlocality\nwould quite naturally be incorporated into our theory as constants of Nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 1996 10:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
