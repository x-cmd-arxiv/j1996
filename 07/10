The EOS is\ncomputed in the framework of the Brueckner--Bethe--Goldstone many--body theory.\nWe introduce three-body forces in order to reproduce the correct saturation\npoint of nuclear matter. A microscopic well behaved EOS is derived. We obtain a\nmaximum mass configuration with $M_{max} = 1.8 M_\\odot$, a radius $R = 9.7$ km\nand a central density $n_c = 1.34~fm^{-3}$. We find the proton fraction exceeds\nthe critical value $x^{Urca}$, for the onset of direct Urca processes, at\ndensities $n \\geq 0.45~fm^{-3}$. Therefore, in our model, NS's with masses\nabove $M^{Urca} = 0.96 M_\\odot$ can undergo very rapid cooling depending on\nwhether or not nucleon superfluidity in the interior of the NS takes place. A\ncomparison with other microscopic models for the EOS is done, and neutron star\nstructure is calculated for these models too.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 1996 10:01:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

It is argued that, in any realistic description of a quantum\nmeasurement that includes a detecting device, it is possible to construct from\nthe statistics of the recorded raw data a set of operational quantities that\ncorrespond to the intrinsic quantum mechanical observable. Using the concept of\nthe propensity and the associated operational positive operator valued measure\n(POVM) a general description of the operational algebra of quantum mechanical\nobservables is derived for a wide class of realistic detection schemes.
