By using the algebraic and topological properties of these\nfields we prove that this construction makes sense and show in physical\nexamples that standard representations as the Bargmann and Schr\\\"odinger\nrepresentation come out correctly, both formally and in a suitable convergence\nscheme. For certain Hamiltonian functions (contained in the Gel'fand ideal of\nthe positive functional) a formal solution to the time-dependent Schr\\\"odinger\nequation is shown to exist. Moreover, we show that for every K\\\"ahler manifold\nequipped with the Fedosov star product of Wick type all the classical delta\nfunctionals are positive and give rise to some formal Bargmann representation\nof the deformed algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 1996 15:20:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Nov 1997 14:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
