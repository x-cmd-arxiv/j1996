After critically discussing several routes for\nderiving a boundary action, we examine their hypothesis in the context of\ngeneric 2-D dilaton gravity. We first calculate the corresponding statistical\nmechanical entropy of black holes in 1+1 deSitter gravity, which has a gauge\ntheory formulation as a BF-theory. Then we generalize the method to dilaton\ngravity theories that do not have a (standard) gauge theory formulation. This\nis facilitated greatly by the Poisson-Sigma-model formulation of these\ntheories. It turns out that the phase space of the boundary particles coincides\nprecisely with a symplectic leaf of the Poisson manifold that enters as target\nspace of the Sigma-model. Despite this qualitatively appealing picture, the\nquantitative results are discouraging: In most of the cases the symplectic\nleaves are non-compact and the number of microstates yields a meaningless\ninfinity. In those cases where the particle phase space is compact - such as,\ne.g., in the Euclidean deSitter theory - the edge state degeneracy is finite,\nbut generically it is far too small to account for the semiclassical\nBekenstein-Hawking entropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Dec 1996 23:46:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
