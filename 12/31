Extensive tests with realistic simulated galaxy\ncatalogs demonstrate that the method produces unbiased estimates of $\\beta_I$\nand its error. When we apply the method to the real data, we model the presence\nof a small but significant velocity quadrupole residual (~3.3% of Hubble flow),\nwhich we argue is due to density fluctuations incompletely sampled by IRAS.

The well-known example is the gauge\nparameter in the covariant gauge fixing which is of course most suitable for\nthe perturbation theory but a negative metric prevents us from imaging a\ndynamical picture. Noncovariant gauge such as the Coulomb gauge is on the\ncontrary used for many physical situations. Therefore it is desirable to\ninclude both cases. More than ten years ago, Steinmann introduced a function\n(distribution) which can play this role in his attempt on discussing quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED) in terms of the gauge invariant fields solely. The method\nis, however, broken down in the covariant case: the invariant operators are\nill-defined because of 1/p^2 singularity in the Minkowski space. In this paper,\nwe apply his function to the path integral: utilizing the arbitrariness of the\nfunction we first restrict it to be able to have a well- defined operator, and\nthen a Hamiltonian with which we can build up the (Euclidean) path integral\nformula. Although the formula is far from covariant, a full covariant\nexpression is recovered by reviving the components which have been discarded\nunder the construction of the Hamiltonian. There is no pathological defects\ncontrary to the operator formalism. With the aid of the path integral formula,\nthe gauge independence of the free energy as well as the S-matrix is proved.\nMoreover the reason is clarified why it is so simple and straightforward to\nargue gauge transformations in the path integral. Discussions on the quark\nconfinement is also presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 1996 19:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

The modified derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation thus has a\nspatially nonlocal nonlinear term describing the long-time evolution of the\nenvelope of parallel-propagating Alfven waves, as well. Coefficients in the\nnonlinear terms are free of the 1/(1-beta) singularity usually encountered in\nprevious analyses, and have very a simple form which clarifies the physical\nprocesses governing the large amplitude Alfvenic nonlinear dynamics.
