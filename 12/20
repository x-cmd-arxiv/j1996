At large voltages, or strong\ncoupling, the conductance of a point-like tunneling junction between an\nelectron gas reservoir and a Laughlin FQH state at filling fraction $\\nu$\nsaturates to a universal value $G={\\frac{2\\nu}{\\nu+1}} {\\frac{e^2}{h}}$.

The particular fraction\n$e^2/h$ is obtained for the case of electron tunneling in and out of a FQH\nliquid by two point contacts. We demonstrate that the problem of tunneling\nbetween an electron gas and a fractional quantum Hall state through an impurity\nis exactly equivalent to the problem of tunneling between a chiral Fermi liquid\nand a chiral Luttinger liquid. We investigate in detail the case of tunneling\nto a $\\nu=1/3$ FQH state which we show to be equivalent to the problem of\ntunneling between two $g=1/2$ chiral Luttinger liquids. This system provides an\nexperimental realization of this important exactly solvable case. We use the\nresults of the single impurity problem to consider the case of many tunneling\ncenters coupled independently to an electron reservoir, which is relevant to\nrecent experiments by A.~Chang et.~al.
