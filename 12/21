As has\nbeen established by comparison with numerical simulations, tree-level\nperturbation theory (PT) describes these quantities at the largest scales.\nOne-loop PT provides a tool to probe the transition to the non-linear regime on\nsmaller scales. In this work, we find that, as a function of spectral index n,\nthe one-loop bispectrum follows a pattern analogous to that of the one-loop\npower spectrum, which shows a change in behavior at a critical index n_c =\n-1.4, where non-linear corrections vanish. For the bispectrum, for n less than\nn_c, one-loop corrections increase the configuration dependence of the leading\norder contribution; for n greater than n_c, one-loop corrections tend to cancel\nthe configuration dependence of the tree-level bispectrum, in agreement with\nknown results from n=-1 numerical simulations. A similar situation is shown to\nhold for the Zel'dovich approximation (ZA), where n_c = -1.75. Using\ndimensional regularization, we obtain explicit analytic expressions for the\none-loop bispectrum for n=-2 initial power spectra, for both the exact dynamics\nof gravitational instability and the ZA. We also compute the skewness factor,\nincluding local averaging of the density field, for n=-2: S_3(R) = 4.02 + 3.83\nsigma^2(R) for gaussian smoothing and S_3(R) = 3.86 + 3.18 sigma^2(R) for\ntop-hat smoothing, where sigma^2(R) is the variance of the density field\nfluctuations smoothed over a window of radius R. Comparison with fully\nnon-linear numerical simulations implies that, for n < -1, one-loop PT can\nextend our understanding of nonlinear clustering down to scales where the\ntransition to the stable clustering regime begins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 1996 01:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Cartan's differential forms description of a\nteleparallel space-time with torsion is modified by introducing distortion\n1-forms which correspond to the distortion tensor in dislocation theory. Under\nthe condition of teleparallelism, the antisymmetrized part of the distorsion\n1-form approximates the electromagnetic field, whereas the antisymmetrized part\nof torsion contributes to the electromagnetic current. Cartan's structure\nequations, the Bianchi identities, Maxwell's equations and the continuity\nequation are thus linked in a most simple way. After these purely geometric\nconsiderations a physical interpretation, using analogies to the theory of\ndefects in ordered media, is given. A simple defect, which is neither a\ndislocation nor disclination proper, appears as source of the electromagnetic\nfield. Since this defect is rotational rather than translational, there seems\nto be no contradiction to Noether's theorem as in other theories relating\ntorsion to electromagnetism. Then,congruences of defect properties and quantum\nbehaviour that arise are discussed, supporting the hypothesis that elementary\nparticles are topological defects of space-time. In agreement with the\ndifferential geometry results, a dimensional analysis indicates that the\nphysical unit (lenght)^2 rather than As is the appropriate unit of the electric\ncharge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Dec 1996 21:36:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Oct 1997 12:50:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
