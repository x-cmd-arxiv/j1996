Eleven of these galaxies are confirmed\nto be at high redshift (median z=3.0), one is at z=0.5, and the other 12 have\nuncertain redshifts but have spectra consistent with their being at z>2.\nCombined with 5 previously confirmed high-redshift galaxies in the HDF, the 16\nconfirmed sources yield a comoving volume density of n>2.5^-4 h50^3 Mpc^-3 for\nq0=0.05, or n>1.2^-3 h50^3 Mpc^-3 for q0=0.5. These densities are comparable to\nestimates of the local volume density of galaxies brighter than L*, and could\nbe almost three times higher still if all 29 of the unconfirmed candidates in\nour original sample are indeed also at high redshift.

Using rest-frame UV continuum fluxes with no dust\ncorrection, we calculate star formation rates in the range 7 - 24 or 3 - 9\nh50^-2 Msun/yr for q0=0.05 and q0=0.5, respectively. The variety of\nmorphologies and the high number density of z=3 galaxies in the HDF suggest\nthat they represent a range of physical processes and stages of galaxy\nformation and evolution, rather than any one class of object, such as massive\nellipticals. A key issue remains the measurement of masses. These high-redshift\nobjects are likely to be the low-mass, starbursting building blocks of more\nmassive galaxies seen today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 1996 04:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-07-18"}

Hirota's method, which has been so useful in soliton theory, is reviewed\nand connections from soliton equations to Painleve equations through similarity\nreductions are discussed from this point of view. In the main part we discuss\nhow singularity structure of the solutions and formal integration of the\nPainleve equations can be used to find a representation in terms of entire\nfunctions. Sometimes the final result is a pair of Hirota bilinear equations,\nbut for $P_{VI}$ we need also a quadrilinear expression. The use of discrete\nversions of Painleve equations is also discussed briefly. It turns out that\nwith discrete equations one gets better information on the singularities, which\ncan then be represented in terms of functions with a simple zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Dec 1996 10:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
