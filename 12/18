Faraday rotation\nin pure scattering atmospheres acts to depolarize the radiation field by\nrotating the polarization planes of photons after last scattering. Absorption\nopacity in an unmagnetized atmosphere can increase or decrease the polarization\ncompared to the pure scattering case, depending on the thermal source function\ngradient. Combining both Faraday rotation and absorption opacity, we find the\nfollowing results. If absorption opacity is much larger than scattering opacity\nthroughout the atmosphere, then Faraday rotation generally has only a small\neffect on the emerging polarization because of the small electron column\ndensity along a photon mean free path. However, if the absorption opacity is\nnot too large and it acts alone to increase the polarization, then the effects\nof Faraday rotation can be enhanced over those in a pure scattering atmosphere.\nFinally, while Faraday rotation often depolarizes the radiation field, it can\nin some cases increase the polarization when the thermal source function does\nnot rise too steeply with optical depth.

The two peaks are\nlocated at V-I = 0.96 and 1.17, which roughly correspond to metallicities of\n[Fe/H] = -1.2 and -0.2 respectively. The luminosity functions of the blue and\nred subpopulations appear to be the same, indicating that luminosity does not\ncorrelate with metallicity within an individual galaxy's globular cluster\nsystem. Our WFPC2 data cover three pointings allowing us to examine the spatial\ndistribution of globular clusters out to 30 kpc (or 2.5 galaxy effective\nradii).

To combat\nthis problem, quantum error correction schemes have been proposed, in which a\nsingle quantum bit (qubit) is ``encoded'' as a state of some larger number of\nqubits, chosen to resist particular types of errors. Most such schemes are\nvulnerable, however, to errors in the encoding and decoding itself.
