The emphasis is drawn to the monopolar peculiar\nvelocities, i.e., peculiar Hubble flows, within these samples. The samples show\ninconsistent peculiar Hubble flows within a depth of $\\sim 60h^{-1}$ Mpc.\nBeyond a depth of $\\sim 80h^{-1}$ Mpc, the Hubble flows of all samples converge\nto the global Hubble flow to better than 10% at the $2\\sigma$ level.
