In the present paper, I demonstrate that one can write\ndown a framework for scalar-tensor theories which predict the MOND\nphenomenology for the low velocity (v<<c) dynamics of galaxies and clusters of\ngalaxies and which are consistent with observations of extragalactic\ngravitational lenses provided that one drops the requirement of the Lorentz\nInvariance of gravitational dynamics. This leads to ``preferred frame''\ntheories characterized by a non-conformal relation between the two metrics. I\ndescribe a toy theory in which the local environment (the solar system, binary\npulsars) is protected from detectable preferred frame effects by the very same\nnon-standard (aquadratic) scalar Lagrangian which gives rise to the MOND\nphenomenology.

Our\ntwo-dimensional simulation begins at 106 ms after bounce at a time when there\nis a well-developed gain region, and proceeds for 400 ms. We couple\ntwo-dimensional (PPM) hydrodynamics to one-dimensional MGFLD neutrino\ntransport.
