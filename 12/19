A general machinery for modding out a symmetry in M(atrix)\ntheory is used for a Z_2 symmetry changing the sign of the X_1 coordinate. The\nconstruction causes the elements of matrices to be equivalent to real numbers\nor quaternions and the symmetry U(2N) of the original model is reduced to O(2N)\nor USp(2N)=U(N,H). We also show that membranes end on the boundary of the\nspacetime correctly in this construction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 1996 22:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 1997 20:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 1997 15:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

The set $J_f\\subset\nC^2$ plays the role of the Julia set $J\\subset{\\bf C}$ for a polynomial map of\nC. In the study of polynomial maps of C a great deal of attention has been paid\nto the connectivity of the Julia set. The focus of this paper is to investigate\nthe J-connected/J-disconnected dichotomy in the case of polynomial\ndiffeomorphisms of C^2.\n  The Jacobian determinant of f is constant. We make the standing assumption\nthat $|det\\ Df|\\le 1$ (this can always be achieved by replacing f by $f^{-1}$\nif necessary). The set $J^-$ is the set of points with bounded backward orbits.\nThe set $U^+$ is the set of points with unbounded forward orbits. Let p be a\nperiodic saddle point and let $W^u(p)$ be its unstable manifold. The set\n$W^u(p)$ will be a Riemann surface conformally equivalent to C.\n  Theorem 1. The following are equivalent:\n  1. For some periodic saddle point p, some component of $W^u(p)\\cap U^+$ is\nsimply connected.\n  2. The set $J^-\\cap U^+$ has a lamination by simply connected leaves so that\nfor any periodic saddle point p each component of $W^u(p)\\cap U^+$ is a leaf of\nthis lamination.\n  3. For any periodic saddle point p, each component of $W^u(p)\\cap U^+$ is\nsimply connected.\n  If f satisfies one of these conditions we say that f is unstably connected.\n  Theorem 2. The set J is connected if and only if f is unstably connected.\n  These results imply that we can determine the connectivity of J by\nconsidering the forward orbits of points in a single unstable manifold. These\nresults open the door to computer exploration of the topology of two\ndimensional Julia sets and the connectivity locus in the parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Dec 1996 19:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
