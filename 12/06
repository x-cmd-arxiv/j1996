While the E2\nand M1 6 hbar Omega operators are one-body operators with free nucleon charges,\nthe effective operators are two-body operators with substantially different\nrenormalization for the isoscalar and isovector matrix elements, especially for\nthe E2 operator. We show that these operators can be very well approximated by\none-body operators provided that effective proton and neutron charges are used.\nThe obtained effective charges are compatible with those used in\nphenomenological shell-model studies. The two-body part of the effective\noperators is estimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Dec 1996 19:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}

It is demonstrated that in the limit of a very small\nbinding energy the valence particles in specific orbitals, characterized by a\nvery small projection of single-particle angular momentum onto the symmetry\naxis of a nucleus, can give rise to the halo structure which is completely\ndecoupled from the rest of the system. The quadrupole deformation of the\nresulting halo is completely determined by the intrinsic structure of a weakly\nbound orbital, irrespective of the shape of the core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Dec 1996 15:10:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
