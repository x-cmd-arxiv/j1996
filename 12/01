The velocity field within 5h-1 Mpc of the\nLocal Group (LG) is extremely ``cold''. The deviation from a pure Hubble flow,\ncharacterized by the observed radial peculiar velocity dispersion, is measured\nto be about 60km/s. We compare the local velocity field with similarly defined\nregions extracted from N-body simulations of Universes dominated by cold dark\nmatter (CDM). This test is able to strongly discriminate between models that\nhave different mean mass densities. We find that neither the Omega=1 (SCDM) nor\nOmega=0.3 (OCDM) cold dark matter models can produce a single candidate Local\nGroup that is embedded in a region with such small peculiar velocities. For\nthese models, we measure velocity dispersions between 500-700km/s and\n150-300km/s respectively, more than twice the observed value. Although both CDM\nmodels fail to produce environments similar to those of our Local Group on a\nscale of a few Mpc, they can give rise to many binary systems that have similar\norbital properties as the Milky Way--Andromeda system. The local,\ngravitationally induced bias of halos in the CDM ``Local Group'' environment,\nif defined within a sphere of 10 Mpc around each Local Group is about 1.5,\nindependent of Omega. No biasing scheme could reconcile the measured velocity\ndispersions around Local Groups with the observed one. Identification of binary\nsystems using a halo finder (named Skid\n(http://www-hpcc.astro.washington.edu/tools/DENMAX for a public version)) based\non local density maxima instead of a simple linking algorithm, gives a much\nmore complete sample. We show that a standard ``friend of friends'' algorithm\nwould miss 40% of the LG candidates present in the simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Dec 1996 05:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The new formulation of causal\nindependence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given\nits parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as\n``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent.

For\nclassical and quantum cases, an interpretation of the f-oscillator is provided\nas corresponding to a special nonlinearity of vibration for which the frequency\nof oscillation depends on the energy. The f-coherent states (nonlinear coherent\nstates) generalizing q-coherent states are constructed. Applied to quantum\noptics, photon distribution function, photon number means, and dispersions are\ncalculated for the f-coherent states as well as the Wigner function and\nQ-function.
