We give a formula for this difference in\nterms of a set of basic classes, expressed in a universal formula involving\nmodular forms. The leading terms coincide with the formulas of Kronheimer and\nMrowka in the simple type case. The basic classes are related to the Seiberg\nWitten invariants. The proof of these results is based on the conjecture of\nKotschick and Morgan on the structure of the wall-crossing terms.

This\nhot source contains ultra-relativistic leptons scattering the disk soft photons\nby Inverse Compton (IC) process. Using simple formula to describe the IC\nprocess in an anisotropic photon field, we derive a self-consistent solution in\nthe Newtonian geometry, where the angular distribution of soft and hard\nradiation, and the radial profile of the disk effective temperature are\ndetermined in a univocal way. This offers an alternative picture to the\nstandard accretion disk emission law, reproducing individual spectra and\npredicting new scaling laws that fit better the observed statistical\nproperties. General relativistic calculations are also carried out. It appears\nthat differences with the Newtonian case are weak, unless the hot source is\nvery close to the black hole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Dec 1996 11:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
