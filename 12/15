We use the CMB\nmeasurements to study inflation-based, cold dark matter (CDM) critical density\nuniverses. We explore the 4-dimensional parameter space having as free\nparameters, Hubble's constant Ho, baryonic fraction Omega_b, the spectral slope\nof scalar perturbations n and the power spectrum quadrupole normalization Q. We\ncalculate chi-squared minimization values and likelihood intervals for these\nparameters. Within the models considered, a low value for the Hubble constant\nis preferred: Ho= 30^{+18}_{-7} km/s/Mpc. The baryonic fraction is not as\nwell-constrained by the CMB data: Omega_b = 0.07^{+ 0.24}_{-0.07}. The power\nspectrum slope is n=0.91^{+0.20}_{-0.12}. The power spectrum normalization is\nQ=18 +/- 2.5 uK. The error bars on each parameter are approximately 1 sigma and\nare for the case where the other 3 parameters have been marginalized. If we\ncondition on n=1 we obtain the normalization Q = 17 +/- 1.0 uK. The permitted\nregions of the 4-D parameter space are presented in a series of 2-D\nprojections. In the context of the CDM critical density universes considered\nhere, current CMB data favor a low value for the Hubble constant. Such low-Ho\nmodels are consistent with Big Bang nucleosynthesis, cluster baryonic\nfractions, the large-scale distribution of galaxies and the ages of globular\nclusters; although in disagreement with direct determinations of the Hubble\nconstant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Dec 1996 03:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 May 1997 15:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

These dibaryons satisfy the condition $(-1)^{T+S}P=+1$\n(where T is the isospin, S is the internal spin and P is the dibaryon parity)\nand their decay into two nucleons is suppressed by the Pauly principle. In the\npresent paper the method of a dibaryon masses reconstruction over the dibaryon\ndecay products (\\gamma nn) and (\\gamma pp) is analysed. The Monte-Carlo\nsimulation is used to choose the optimal location of the detectors, to estimate\nthe contribution of the main background processes and to calculate the expected\nyields of the dibaryon production. It is shown that 100 hours of the exposition\ntime at the microtron MAMI (Mainz) is quite enough to determine whether or not\nthe supernarrow dibaryons with symmetric wave function exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Dec 1996 17:10:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Dec 1996 09:32:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
