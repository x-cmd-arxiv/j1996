It is applied to the study of\nphoto-reionization models in which the amplitude, spectrum and onset epoch of\nthe ionizing flux, as well as the cosmology, are systematically varied. We find\nthat the mean temperature-density relation at z=2-4 is well approximated by a\npower-law equation of state for uniform reionization models. We derive\nanalytical expressions for its evolution and exhibit its asymptotic behavior:\nit is found that for sufficiently early reionization, imprints of reionization\nhistory prior to z=10 on the temperature-density relation are washed out. In\nthis limit the temperature at cosmic mean density is proportional to (\\Omega_b\nh/\\sqrt\\Omega_0)^{1/1.7}. While the amplitude of the radiation flux at the\nionizing frequency of HI is found to have a negligible effect on the\ntemperature-density relation as long as the universe reionizes before z=5, the\nspectrum can change the overall temperature by about 20%, through variations in\nthe abundances of helium species. However the slope of the mean equation of\nstate is found to lie within a narrow range for all reionization models we\nstudy, where reionization takes place before z=5. We discuss the implications\nof these findings for the observational properties of the Lyman-alpha forest.\nIn particular, uncertainties in the temperature of the intergalactic medium,\ndue to the uncertain reionization history of our universe, introduces a 30%\nscaling in the amplitude of the column density distribution while the the slope\nof the distribution is only affected by about 5%. Finally, we discuss how a\nfluctuating ionizing field affects the above results.

The explicit\nrepresentation is shown for the SU(2) theory with matter fields and also for\npure SU(N) and pure SO(2N) theory around the conformal point where the relation\nto the beta function of the theory is clarified.

It is found that spherical membranes moving in flat target\nspacetime backgrounds admit a class of integrable solutions linked to SU(infty)\nSDYM equations (dimensionally reduced to one temporal dimension). After a\nsuitable ansatz, the SDYM equations can be recast in the form of the continuous\nToda molecule equations whose symmetry algebra is the dimensional reduction of\nthe W (infty} plus {\\bar W}(infty} algebra. The latter algebra is explicitly\nconstructed. Highest weight representations are built directly from the\ninfinite number of defining relations among the highest weight states of\nW(\\infty) algebras and the quantum states of the Toda molecule. Discrete states\nare also constructed. The full (dimensionaly reduced) quantum SU(infty) YM\ntheory remains to be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 1996 06:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
