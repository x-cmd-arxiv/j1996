We have\nfound that all non-rotating and slowly rotating members of this sequence\nrounder than E7 are stable, and that even maximally rotating models rounder\nthan E4 are stable. In the absence of strong rotation, the most disruptive\ninstability, and the last to be stabilized by increasing thickness, is a\nlopsided (m=1) mode. This instability appears to be driven by counter-rotation\nin radially cool models. Its vigour is lessened as rotation is increased, but\nit remains strong even in models with net angular momentum 90% of that of a\nmaximally rotating model before finally disappearing in maximally rotating\nmodels. Strongly rotating models are more unstable to bar-forming modes which\nafflict maximally rotating models with c/a >~ 0.5, but this mode is quickly\nstabilized by moderate fractions of counter-rotating particles. Bending\ninstabilities appear not to be very important; they are detectable in the inner\nparts of the flatter models, but are less vigorous and more easily stabilized\nthan the lop-sided or bar modes in every case.

We work with the standard electroweak theory augmented by\nthe addition of a CP violating dimension six operator. We work in the context\nof a first order phase transition, but the processes we describe can also occur\nduring the evolution of a network of topological defects. Both the approaches\nwe explore deal with circumstances where the bubble walls which convert the\nhigh temperature phase to the low temperature phase are thin and rapidly\nmoving. We first consider the dynamics of localized configurations with winding\nnumber one which remain in the broken phase immediately after the bubble wall\nhas passed. Their subsequent decay can anomalously produce fermions. In a\nprelude to our analysis of this effect, we demonstrate how to define the C and\nCP symmetries in the bosonic sector of the electroweak theory when\nconfigurations with nonzero winding are taken into account. Second, we consider\nthe effect of the passage of the wall itself on configurations which happen to\nbe near the crest of the ridge between vacua as the wall arrives. We find that\nneither of the simple approaches followed here can be pushed far enough to\nobtain a convincing estimate of the BAU which is produced. A large scale\nnumerical treatment seems necessary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Dec 1996 01:55:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 1997 00:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Apr 1997 18:54:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
