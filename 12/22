In contrast, no widely accepted theory exists for the origin of\nultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which have energies above $10^{15}$ eV.\nInstead of proposing a specific model, here we place strong constraints on any\nmodel of UHECRs involving isolated neutron stars (no companions). We consider\nthe total power requirements and show that the only viable power source\nassociated with isolated neutron stars is rotation. Mechanisms based on\naccretion from the interstellar medium fall short of the necessary power\ndespite the most optimistic assumptions. Power considerations also demonstrate\nthat not enough rotational energy is tapped by a \"propeller\"-like acceleration\nof interstellar matter. The most promising source of energy is rotational\nspindown via magnetic braking.

We choose $S =\nln\\Omega$ as the candidate ``gravitational entropy'' function, where $\\Omega$\nis the phase-space volume below the Hamiltonian H of the system under\nconsideration. We compute $\\Omega$ for transverse electromagnetic waves and for\ngravitational wave, radiation and density perturbations in an expanding FLRW\nuniverse. These calculations are carried out in the linear regime under the\nassumption that the phases of the oscillators comprising the system are random.\nEntropy is thus attributed to the lack of knowledge of the exact field\nconfiguration. We find that $\\Omega$, and hence $ln\\Omega$ behaves as required.\nWe also carry out calculations for Bianchi IX cosmological models and find\nthat, even in this homogeneous case, the function can be interpreted sensibly.\nWe compare our results with Penrose's C^2 hypothesis. Because S is defined to\nresemble the fundamental statistical mechanics definition of entropy, we are\nable to recover the entropy in a variety of familiar circumstances including,\nevidently, black-hole entropy. The results point to the utility of the\nrelativistic ADM Hamiltonian formalism in establishing a connection between\ngeneral relativity and statistical mechanics, although fully nonlinear\ncalculations will need to be performed to remove any doubt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Dec 1996 20:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2011-09-09"}
