We\nfind noticeable violations of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem and we\nobserve also that the energy diffusion has a markedly non-Gaussian character.\nWithin the Feynman-Vernon path integral formalism and in the Markovian limit,\nwe further consider the time evolution of a slow subsystem coupled to such a\n``bath'' of intrinsic degrees of freedom. We show that dissipation leads to\nqualitative modifications of the time evolution of the density matrix of the\nslow subsystem. In either the spatial, momentum or energy representation the\ndensity distribution acquires very long tails and tunneling is greatly\nenhanced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 1996 21:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}

This method, called\n$H^n$-cooling method, is applied to the study of the quadrupole collective\nmotion of $^{56}$Fe, $^{54}$Cr, $^{58}$Fe and $^{56}$Cr. The shell-model\nwavefunctions of lowest-lying states of these nuclei are well treated by this\nmethod. By using the wavefunctions obtained via the $H^n$-cooling method, IBM-2\nparameters are derived from a realistic shell-model hamiltonian and transition\noperators. The Majorana interaction becomes sizably repulsive, primarily as an\neffect of the renormalization. The bosonic E2 effective-charges are enhanced\ndue to the renormalization, while a quenching occurs in the M1 and M3\nparameters for proton bosons. It is shown that the $\\chi$ parameters take\nsimilar values in the hamiltonian and in the E2 operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Dec 1996 09:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
