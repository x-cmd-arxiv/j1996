We do not intend to give a general and critical review, but\ninstead concentrate mainly on our approach, however, incorporating many of the\nrecent attempts in the literature. We calculate the contributions to the\ndilepton yield arising from pion annihilation and $\\pi -\\rho$ scattering. It is\nshown that thermal dileptons from $\\pi -\\rho$ scattering give a significant\ncontribution to the low-mass yield, however, it can only partly account for the\nexperimentally observed soft dilepton excess seen in S-Au and Pb-Au collisions\nat SPS energy. The out off-equilibrium effects as well as a dropping vector\nmeson mass are discussed in the context of the thermal dilepton yield. We\nemphasize, following the results of Li, Ko, and Brown, that, until now, the\nbest way to provide a quantitative explanation of the observed enhancement of\nlow-mass dileptons by the CERN experiments is the assumption of a decreasing\nvector meson mass in a high density thermal medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 1996 10:44:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
