Its virtues\ninclude unifying relativity and quantum mechanics, and particles with de\nBroglie waves. It also appears to provide a truly unified physical basis for\nelectromagnetic, gravitational and nuclear forces. The basic system is a\nfour-dimensional Euclidean space, containing an array of nonlinear \"flow\"\nwaves. These repeat in one dimension, called [phi]. As in Newtonian mechanics,\ntime is treated as an additional, unidirectional parameter describing the\nevolution of the system. Nevertheless, this wave system is shown be inherently\nrelativistic. Further self-organizing patterns arise within the overall wave\nstructure. Called \"wavicles,\" these have intrinsic quantized fields, \"spin,\"\nand rest energy, and represent elementary particles. Relativistic expressions\nare derived for particle behavior in scalar, vector and gravitational\npotentials. Proper representations of these potentials, based on the wave\nfields and associated [phi] flows of wavicles, are also obtained. As in the\ncausal quantum mechanics of de Broglie and Bohm, wavicles exist continuously\nand follow definite, stochastic trajectories. Although experimentally\nequivalent to Einstein's special relativity, this theory differs fundamentally\nfrom his general relativity and the associated Big Bang model. According to\nLinde, the latter predict a large-scale space-time curvature roughly 60 orders\nof magnitude greater than observed values. Here a flat large-scale geometry is\npredicted, in agreement with the observed distribution of galaxies. This theory\nis also consistent with recent observations pertaining to the age of the\nuniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Dec 1996 09:22:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
