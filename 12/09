Morphological structure of the galaxy in\nHalpha and in the red continuum is investigated. We also analyse the velocity\nfield of the ionized gas. Besides the two compact HII components of the main\nbody we find a population of small HII regions in its surroundings whose\ndiameter distribution and Halpha luminosity function are consistent with those\nobserved in dwarf Irregular galaxies. In the main body of the galaxy besides of\nthe NW and SE red continuum peaks which are displaced with respect to the\nHalpha maxima, three new red condensations have been discovered. They have no\nclear Halpha counterparts. The velocity field in IZW18 shows peculiar motions\nsuperimposed on a quite regular background implying solid-body rotation with a\ngradient of about 70km/sec/ kpc. The Halpha line profiles exhibit an asymmetric\nstructure, except for the NW main compact component. At least part of this\nasymmetry could result from accreted and/or expelled surrounding gas from the\nmain star-forming core(s) of the galaxy. Contrary to previous suggestions that\nthe south-west and north-east extensions of this galaxy are diffused emission\nproduced by bipolar emitting gas we provide evidence that they are HII regions\npowered by star formation sites. The redshift of the Zwicky's \"flare\" has been\nmeasured for the first time and corresponds to the same velocity as IZW18. In\nsuch a context the optical ridge that appears to be an isolated morphological\nstructure has a shape that may result from the gravitational interaction with\nthe Zwicky's \"flare\" if this latter is a neighbour extreme dwarf object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 1996 10:56:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

The essential idea is that stars\ncomposed of ordinary (as opposed to dark matter) experience Newtonian forces\ndue to the presence of an all pervading background of massive gravitationally\ncharged cold dark matter. The novel gravitational interactions are predicted to\nhave a significant influence on pre-inflationary cosmology. The precise details\ndepend on the nature of a gravitational Proca interaction and the description\nof matter. A gravitational Proca field configuration that gives rise to\nattractive forces between dark matter charges of like polarity exhibits\nhomogeneous isotropic eternal cosmologies that are free of cosmological\ncurvature singularities thus eliminating the horizon problem associated with\nthe standard big-bang scenario. Such solutions do however admit dense hot\npre-inflationary epochs each with a characteristic scale factor that may be\ncorrelated with the dark matter density in the current era of expansion. The\nmodel is based on a theory in which a modification of Einsteinian gravity at\nvery short distances can be expressed in terms of the gradient of the Einstein\nmetric and the torsion of a non-Riemannian connection on the bundle of linear\nframes over spacetime.

The most\nimportant of these are the need to introduce degrees of freedom initialized on\ntwo different null planes, the proper incorporation of gauge field zero modes\nwhen periodicity conditions are used to regulate the infrared, and the\nimportance of carefully regulating singular operator products in a\ngauge-invariant way. We then consider SU(2) Yang-Mills theory in 1+1 dimensions\ncoupled to massless adjoint fermions. With all fields in the adjoint\nrepresentation the gauge group is actually SU(2)$/Z_2$, which possesses\nnontrivial topology. In particular, there are two topological sectors and the\nphysical vacuum state has a structure analogous to a $\\theta$ vacuum. We\nformulate the model using periodicity conditions in $x^\\pm$ for infrared\nregulation, and consider a solution in which the gauge field zero mode is\ntreated as a constrained operator.

In this paper it is shown that if such a\n$W$ is the universal cover of a connected, {\\bf P}$^2$-irreducible open\n3-manifold $M$ with finitely generated fundamental group, then either $W$ is\nhomeomorphic to {\\bf R}$^3$ or the group is a free product of infinite cyclic\ngroups and infinite closed surface groups. Given any such finitely generated\ngroup uncountably many $M$ are constructed with that fundamental group such\nthat their universal covers are {\\bf R}$^2$-irreducible, are not homeomorphic\nto {\\bf R}$^3$, and are pairwise non-homeomorphic. These results are related to\nthe conjecture that closed, orientable, irreducible, aspherical 3-manifolds are\ncovered by {\\bf R}$^3$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-07"}
