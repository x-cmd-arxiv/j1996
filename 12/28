By applying a median normalizing\nspatial filter, we were able to eliminate the strong gradient in brightness\ntowards the Galactic midplane. The resulting images reveal a \"froth\" of\nsuperposed filaments, voids, and shells. This fine-scale structure extends all\nthe way down to the Galactic midplane. Moreover, it scales in intensity with\nthe smoothly varying background, independent of latitude, thus indicating that\nthe fine-scale residual emission is co-extensive with the smooth background. We\nconclude that the fine-scale structure is not merely of local origin, but\nconsists of both nearby and more distant features in the disk. Although we had\nexpected to find morphological evidence for supernova-driven \"worms\" or\n\"chimneys\" rooted in the Galactic plane, our processing shows the FIR\nfine-scale structure to be more complex (e.g. less coherent and less rooted) as\nviewed in projection. Analysis of the spatial statistics shows that the FIR\nfine-scale structure is self-similar with a spatial power-law exponent of -3\nand a fractal dimension of 2.5 --- similar behavior to that found in isolated\ncirrus and molecular clouds. On scales larger than 1.5 deg, the power-law\nexponent flattens to -2.5, perhaps indicating a change in the characteristic\nstructure. This could be due to different dynamical inputs organizing the small\nand large-scale structures (e.g. turbulence and diffusion on small scales vs.\nmacroscopic winds and shock fronts on larger scales).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 1996 19:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

Even\nthough this is a very old problem of statics, no simple algorithms are\navailable for it so the most usual approach has been to solve the elastic\nequations, which is very time-consuming for large systems. Recently an integer\nalgorithm was proposed for this problem in two dimensions, using matching\nmethods from graph theory and Laman's theorem for two-dimensional graphs. The\nmethod is relatively simple, but its time complexity grows as $n^2$ in the\nworst case, and almost as fast on practical cases, so that an improvement is\nhighly desirable. I describe here a further elaboration of that procedure,\nwhich relies upon the description of the system as a collection of rigid bodies\nconnected by bars, instead of sites connected by bars. Sets of rigidly\nconnected objects are replaced by a unique body, and this is done recursively\nas more rigid connections between bodies are discovered at larger scales. As a\nconsequence of this ``rescaling transformation'', our algorithm has much\nimproved average behavior, even when its worst-case complexity remains $n^2$.\nThe time complexity of the body-bar algorithm is found to scale as $n^{1.12}$\nfor the randomly diluted triangular lattice, while the original site-bar\nversion scales as $n^{1.9}$ on the same problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Dec 1996 16:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
