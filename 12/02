We\nstudy such changes by using a chiral confining model of the nucleon. We use\ndensity-dependent masses for all mesons except the pion. Within a\nDirac-Brueckner analysis, based on the relativistic covariant structure of the\nNN amplitude, we show that the effect of such a density dependence in the NN\ninteraction on the saturation properties of nuclear matter, while not large, is\nquite significant. Due to the density dependence of the $g_{\\sigma NN}$, as\npredicted by the chiral confining model, we find, in particular, a looping\nbehavior of the binding energy at saturation as a function of the saturation\ndensity. A simple model is described, which exhibits looping and which is shown\nto be mainly caused by the presence of a peak in the density dependence of the\nmedium modified $\\sigma N$ coupling constant at low density.\n  The effect of density dependence of the coupling constants and the meson\nmasses tends to improve the results for $E/A$ and density of nuclear matter at\nsaturation. From the present study we see that the relationship between binding\nenergy and saturation density may not be as universal as found in\nnonrelativistic studies and that more model dependence is exhibited once medium\nmodifications of the basic nuclear interactions are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Dec 1996 09:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Dec 1996 13:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-15"}
