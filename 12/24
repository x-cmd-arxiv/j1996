All groups have the same mass and binding energy. We consider both\ncases with individual halos and cases where the halo is common to all galaxies\nand enveloping the whole group. In the latter situation the merging rate is\nslower if the halo is more massive. The mass of individual halos has little\ninfluence on the merging rates, due to the fact that all galaxies in our\nsimulations have the same mass, and so the more extended ones have a smaller\nvelocity dispersion. Groups with individual halos merge faster than groups with\ncommon halos if the configuration is centrally concentrated, like a King\ndistribution of index 10. On the other hand for less concentrated\nconfigurations the merging is initially faster for individual halo cases, and\nslower after part of the group has merged. In cases with common halo, centrally\nconcentrated configurations merge faster for high halo-to-total mass ratios and\nslower for low halo-to-total mass ratios. Groups whose virial ratio is\ninitially less than one merge faster, while groups that have initially\ncylindrical rotation merge slower than groups starting in virial equilibrium.\nIn order to test how long a virialised group can survive before merging we\nfollowed the evolution of a group with a high halo-to-total mass ratio and a\ndensity distribution with very little central concentration. We find that the\nfirst merging occurred only after a large number of crossing times, which with\nareasonable calibration should be larger than a Hubble time. Hence, at least\nfor appropriate initial conditions, the longevity of compact groups is not\nnecessarily a problem, which is an alternative explanation to why we observe so\nmany compact groups despite the fact that their lifetimes seem short.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Dec 1996 17:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}
