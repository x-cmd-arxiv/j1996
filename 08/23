Combining our new data set with previous surveys we find that the\ncosmological mass density in neutral gas, omega_g, does not rise as steeply\nprior to z~2 as indicated by previous studies. There is evidence in the\nobserved omega_g for a flattening at z~2 and a possible turnover at z~3.

We explore fermion number violating processes which involve soliton\ndecay. A soliton can decay by tunnelling under the sphaleron barrier or the\ndecay can be collision induced if the energy is sufficient for the barrier to\nbe traversed. We discuss classical solutions to the Minkowski space equations\nof motion in which a soliton is kicked over the barrier by an incoming pulse.\nWe then consider a limit in which we can reliably estimate the amplitude for\nsoliton decay induced by collision with a single W-boson. This amplitude\ndepends on g like exp[-cg^(-1/3)], and is larger than that for spontaneous\ndecay via tunnelling in the same limit.

It gives rise\nto exotic massless states which cannot fit into multiplets of the original\nunifying gauge group. This is an important feature because it results in\nconservation laws which forbid the interaction of the exotic ``Wilsonian''\nstates with the Standard Model states.

The fixing of the coupling, however, is much more\ninvolved outside the complete on-shell scheme.
