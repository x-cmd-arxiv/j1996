In spite of the extreme\nconditions expected to prevail in this innermost, central environment, the\nradiative clouds can survive and maintain cool temperatures relative to the\nambient emitting region by means of magnetic confinement. Motivated by these\nideas, we present a detailed quantitative study of such clouds, explicitly\ndescribing the physical properties they can attain under thermal and radiative\nequilibrium conditions. We also discuss the thermal stability of the gas in\ncomparison to that of other reprocessing material thought to reside at larger\ndistances from the central source. We construct a model to predict the emergent\nspectra from a source region containing dense clouds which absorb and reemit\nthe primary radiation generated therein. Our predicted spectra show the\nfollowing two important results: (i) the reprocessed flux emitted at optical/UV\nenergies is insufficient to account for the blue bump component in the observed\nspectra; and (ii) the amount of line radiation that is emitted is at least\ncomparable to (and in many cases dominates) the continuum radiation. The lines\nare extremely broad and tend to accumulate in the extreme ultraviolet, where\nthey form a peak much more prominent than that which is observed in the\noptical/UV. This result is supported by current observations, which indicate\nthat the spectral energy distribution of radio-quiet AGN may indeed reach a\nmaximum in the EUV band.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Aug 1996 23:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

The new constraints indicate not only\nthat the Galaxy is a more typical member of its class (Sb-Sc spirals) than\npreviously thought, but also require a re-examination of the question of\nwhether or not the Milky Way disk is maximal. By applying to the Milky Way the\nsame definition of ``maximal disk'' that is applied to external galaxies, it is\nshown that the new observational constraints are consistent with a Galactic\nmaximal disk of reasonable $M/L$.
