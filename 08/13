These processes are hard to model with basic physics because\nthey are complex and allow a rich variety of expression. Instead observations\nwill determine when the first stars and quasars formed, and how and when\ngalaxies assembled. If we can reconcile the numerous contradictions which\ncharacterize the subject today, cosmology will become a mature subject, founded\non the agreement between detailed, inclusive and realistic models, which make\nprecise predictions, and the wealth of new data which will come from a wide\nvariety of observations, at all wavelengths.

This is achieved by coupling the covariantly quantized\nGreen-Schwarz superstring of Berkovits to a curved background and requiring\nthat the sigma model has superconformal invariance at tree level and at one\nloop in $\\a'$. Tree level superconformal invariance yields the complete\nsupergravity algebra, and one-loop superconformal invariance the equations of\nmotion of the low energy theory. The resulting low energy theory is old-minimal\nsupergravity coupled to a tensor multiplet. The dilaton is part of the\ncompensator multiplet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 1996 21:29:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-26"}
