We identify several observational signatures of recent merger\nactivity, and quantitatively assess the uncertainty introduced into cluster\nmass estimates when invoking the commonly held assumptions of hydrostatic\nequilibrium, virial equilibrium, spherical symmetry and isothermality. We find\nthat mergers result in multiple X-ray peaks, long-lived elongation of the X-ray\nemission as well as isophotal twisting and centroid shifting to a degree\nconsistent with recent observations. We also find an enlargement of the X-ray\ncore relative to the dark matter core. Mergers result in non-isothermal\nclusters exhibiting observable inhomogeneities in the emission-weighted X-ray\ntemperature of several keV on linear scales of less than 0.5 Mpc. The resulting\ngas dynamics are extremely complex, and we present an example of what might be\nobserved by a high resolution X-ray spectrograph. We further speculate that the\ngas dynamics, via shocks, bulk flows and turbulence, play an important role in\nthe evolution of cluster galaxies and associated radio sources, particularly\nwide-angle tailed (WAT) sources and radio halos. We find that X-ray based by\ncluster mass estimates made under equilibrium assumptions can be uncertain 50\\%\nor more in the first 2 Gyrs after a merger and by up to 25\\% after 2 Gyrs\ndepending on the details of the analysis and projection effects.
