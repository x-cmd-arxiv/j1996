We compute the\nuniversal forms of this correlator for both cases of conserved and broken time\nreversal symmetry. For a symmetric dot the correlator is independent of the\ndetails in each lead such as the number of channels and their correlation. We\nderive a new scaling, which we call the rotation scaling, that can be computed\ndirectly from the dot's eigenfunction rotation rate or alternatively from the\nconductance peak heights, and therefore does not require knowledge of the\nspectrum of the dot. The relation of the rotation scaling to the level velocity\nscaling is discussed. The exact analytic form of the conductance peak\ncorrelator is derived at short distances. We also calculate the universal\ndistributions of the average level width velocity for various values of the\nscaled parameter. The universality is illustrated in an Anderson model of a\ndisordered dot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 1996 01:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
