Close to onset, the asymptotic expansion\nyields an amplitude equation which is of gradient form, and allows the explicit\ncalculation of the functional form of the cubic nonlinearities. In particular,\nwe find that three-wave resonant interactions contribute significantly to the\nnonlinear terms, and therefore are important for pattern selection.\nMinimization of the associated Lyapunov functional predicts a primary\nbifurcation to a standing wave pattern of square symmetry for\ncapillary-dominated surface waves, in agreement with experiments.
