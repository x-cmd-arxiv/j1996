It\ninvolves a two-component formulation of the corresponding Klein-Gordon\nequation. A precise definition of the adiabatic approximation is offered and\nconditions of its validity are discussed. It is shown that the adiabatic\ngeometric phase can be computed without making a particular choice for an inner\nproduct on the space of solutions of the field equations. What is needed is\njust an inner product on the Hilbert space of the square integrable functions\ndefined on the spatial hypersurfaces. The two-component formalism is applied in\nthe investigation of the adiabatic geometric phases for several specific\nexamples, namely, a rotating magnetic field in Minkowski space, a rotating\ncosmic string, and an arbitrary spatially homogeneous cosmological background.\nIt is shown that the two-component formalism reproduces the known results for\nthe first two examples. It also leads to several interesting results for the\ncase of spatially homogeneous cosmological models. In particular, it is shown\nthat the adiabatic geometric phase angles vanish for Bianchi type I models. The\nsituation is completely different for Bianchi type IX models where a variety of\nnontrivial non-Abelian adiabatic geometrical phases can occur. The analogy\nbetween the adiabatic geometric phases induced by the Bianchi type IX\nbackgrounds and those associated with the well-known time-dependent nuclear\nquadrupole Hamiltonians is also pointed out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 1996 01:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Sep 1996 22:19:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Jun 1997 20:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
