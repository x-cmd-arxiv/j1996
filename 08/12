All the images\nshow the shell-like morphology characteristic of previously obtained broad-band\nX-ray images, but are clearly distinct from each other. We use image\nreconstruction techniques to achieve a spatial resolution of ~0.8'. Line\nintensity ratios are used to make inferences about the remnant's physical\nstate, on average for the entire remnant, and with angular position around the\nrim. The average temperature (T) of the Si and S ejecta in the remnant is\n(0.8-1.1) X 10^7 K and the average ionization age (nt) is (0.8-1.3) X 10^11\ncm^-3 s. For a constant nt, the observed relative brightness variations of Si\nand S line image profiles with azimuthalangle imply differences of roughly a\nfactor of 1.3-1.8 in the temperature. We compare the radial brightness profiles\nof our images to simple geometrical models, and find that a spherical emitting\ngeometry is favored over a torus. A spherical geometry is further supported by\nthe absence of systematic Doppler shifts across the remnant. The radial fit\nresults also suggest that some radial mixing of the ejecta has occurred.\nHowever, the azimuthally averaged Fe K image peaks at a markedly lower radius\nthan the other images. The average Fe K / Fe L line intensity ratio and the\nposition of the Fe K energy centroid support a T several times higher and an nt\napprox. a factor of ten lower than for the other elements, and imply that the\nFe ejecta must have retained some of its stratification. Although many of the\nfeatures in the 4-6 keV X-ray continuum correspond to those in the radio, there\nis no obvious correlation between the relative brightness in these bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 1996 22:21:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

It enables us to use standard\nvariational schemes, based on $sl(2)$ generalized coherent states as trial\nfunctions, for solving both spectral and evolution tasks. In such a manner a\nnew analytical expression is found for energy spectra in a mean-field\napproximation which is beyond quasi-equidistant ones obtained earlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Aug 1996 14:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}
