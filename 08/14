We conjecture that this lopsidedness is caused by tidal\ninteractions and calculate an UPPER limit on the accretion rate of small\ngalaxies. We exploit the correlation between lopsidedness and photometric\nmeasures of recent star formation (Zaritsky 1995) to obtain two independent\nestimates of the lifetime of these m=1 distortions. First, we show that\nlopsided galaxies have an excess of blue luminosity relative to that of\nsymmetric galaxies with the same H I linewidth, which we attribute to a recent\nstar formation episode that was triggered by an interaction between the galaxy\nand a companion. We use stellar populations models (Bruzual and Charlot 1993)\nto estimate the time since that interaction. Second, we use the N-body\nsimulation of an infalling satellite by Walker, Mihos, and Hernquist (1996) to\nestimate how fast tidally induced m=1 distortions are erased through phase\nmixing. Both approaches indicate that the observations are consistent with a\nhypothesized tidal interaction that occurred about 1 Gyr ago for galaxies that\nare lopsided at the 20% level. By combining this lifetime estimate for\nlopsidedness, the observed frequency of such distortions, and a correction to\nthe survey volume that depends on the increase in luminosity during an\ninteraction, we derive an upper limit on the current companion accretion rate\nof field spiral galaxies (for companion masses of about 10% parent galaxy mass)\nthat lies in the range 0.07 - 0.25 per Gyr.

We select groups with $N \\geq 3$\nmembers based on projected separation and association in redshift space alone.\nWe evaluate the characteristics of the Redshift Survey Compact Groups (RSCG's).\nTheir physical properties (membership frequency, velocity dispersion, density)\nare similar to those of the Hickson [ApJ, 255, 382 (1982)] Compact Groups.\nHickson's isolation criterion is a strong function of the physical and angular\ngroup radii and is a poor predictor of the group environment. In fact, most\nRSCG's are embedded in dense environments. The luminosity function for RSCG's\nis mildly inconsistent with the survey luminosity function --- the\ncharacteristic luminosity is brighter and the faint end shallower for the RSCG\ngalaxies. We construct a model of the selection function of compact groups.\nUsing this selection function, we estimate the abundance of RSCG's; for groups\nwith $N \\geq 4$ members the abundance is $3.8 \\times 10^{-5} h^3 Mpc^{-3}$. For\nall RSCG's ($N \\geq 3$) the abundance is $1.4 \\times 10^{-4} h^3 Mpc^{-3}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 1996 14:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

Intelligent states minimize\nuncertainty relations and this makes possible an essential reduction of the\nquantum noise in interferometers. Exact closed expressions for the minimum\ndetectable phase shift are obtained in terms of the Jacobi polynomials. These\nexpressions are compared with results for some conventional input states, and\nsome known results for the squeezed input states are reviewed. It is shown that\nthe phase sensitivity for an interferometer that employs squeezing-producing\nactive devices (such as four-wave mixers) should be analyzed in two regimes:\n(i) fixed input state and variable interferometer, and (ii) fixed\ninterferometer and variable input state. The behavior of the phase sensitivity\nis essentially different in these two regimes. The use of the SU(2) intelligent\nstates allows us to achieve a phase sensitivity of order $1/\\bar{N}$ (where\n$\\bar{N}$ is the total number of photons passing through the phase shifters of\nthe interferometer) without adding four-wave mixers. This avoids the duality in\nthe behavior of the phase sensitivity that occurs for the squeezed input. On\nthe other hand, the SU(1,1) intelligent states have the property of achieving\nthe phase sensitivity of order $1/\\bar{N}$ in both regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 1996 13:15:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
