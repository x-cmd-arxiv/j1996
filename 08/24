An approximation is introduced in which the column\ndensity distribution is related to a statistic of density peaks (involving its\nheight and first and second derivatives along the line of sight) in real space.\nWe show that the slope of the column density distribution is determined by the\ntemperature-density relation as well as the power spectrum on scales $2 h\nMpc^{-1} < k < 20 h Mpc^{-1}$.
