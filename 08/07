Pulsars beyond---but viewed\nthrough---the Galactic center suffer even greater pulse broadening and are\nangularly broadened by <~ 2 {\\em arc min}. Periodicity searches at radio\nfrequencies are likely to find only long period pulsars and, then, only if\noptimized by using frequencies >~ 7 GHz and by testing for small numbers of\nharmonics in the power spectrum.

We\nestimate that the number of {\\em detectable} pulsars in the Galactic center may\nrange from <= 1 to 100, with the larger values resulting from recent, vigorous\nstarbursts. Such pulsars provide unique opportunities for probing the ionized\ngas, gravitational potential, and stellar population near Sgr A*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 1996 17:46:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

It is assumed that wounded nucleons with different\nnumber of interacted quarks hadronize in different ways. The probabilities of\nhaving such wounded nucleons are evaluated for proton-proton, proton-nucleus\nand nucleus-nucleus collisions. After examining our model in proton-proton and\nproton-nucleus collisions and fixing the hadronization functions, it is\nextended to nucleus-nucleus collisions. It is used to calculate the rapidity\ndistribution and the rapidity shift of final state protons in nucleus-nucleus\ncollisions. The computed results are in good agreement with the experimental\ndata on $^{32}\\mbox{S} +\\ ^{32}\\mbox{S}$ at $E_{lab} = 200$ AGeV and\n$^{208}\\mbox{Pb} +\\ ^{208}\\mbox{Pb}$ at $E_{lab} = 160$ AGeV. Theoretical\npredictions are also given for proton rapidity distribution in $^{197}\\mbox{Au}\n+\\ ^{197}\\mbox{Au}$ at $\\sqrt{s} = 200$ AGeV (BNL-RHIC). We predict that the\nnearly baryon free region will appear in the midrapidity region and the\nrapidity shift is $\\langle \\Delta y \\rangle = 2.22$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 1996 06:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
