The precision with which polarization and cross-correlation\npower spectra can be determined is limited by cosmic variance, noise and\nforeground residuals. Choice of estimator can significantly improve our\ncapability of extracting cosmological signal and in the noise dominated limit\nthe optimal power spectrum estimator reduces the variance by a factor of two\ncompared to the simplest estimator.
