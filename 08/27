The model considers an exciton as a neutral composite\nconsisting of three quasielectrons and a single hole. The AEM works well when\nthe separation between electron and hole confinement planes, h, is larger than\nthe magnetic length l. In the framework of the AEM an exciton possesses\nmomentum k and two internal quantum numbers, one of which can be chosen as the\nangular momentum, L, of the k=0 state. Existence of the internal degrees of\nfreedom results in the multiple branch energy spectrum, crater-like electron\ndensity shape and 120 degrees density correlations for k=0 excitons, and the\nsplitting of the electron shell into bunches for non-zero k excitons. For h\nlarger than 2l the bottom states obey the superselection rule L=3m (m are\nintegers starting from 2), all of them are hard core states.

The mass terms\narise as a consequence of making a more general ansatz than that in usual\nKaluza-Klein dimensional reduction, in which one or more axions are given an\nadditional linear dependence on one of the compactification coordinates. The\nlower-dimensional theories are nevertheless consistent truncations of\neleven-dimensional supergravity. Owing to the fact that the generalised\nreduction commutes neither with U-duality nor with ordinary dimensional\nreduction, many different massive theories can result. The simplest examples\narise when just a single axion has the additional linear coordinate dependence.\nWe find five inequivalent such theories in D=7, and 71 inequivalent ones in\nD=4. The massive theories admit no maximally-symmetric vacuum solution, but\nthey do admit $(D-2)$-brane solutions, i.e. domain walls, which preserve half\nthe supersymmetry. We present examples of these solutions, and their oxidations\nto D=11. Some of the latter are new solutions of D=11 supergravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 1996 16:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Sep 1996 15:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 1996 00:43:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-07"}
