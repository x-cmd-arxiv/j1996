This\nitinerancy is most prominent in the time scale $t\\sim 10^5 \\sim 10^6 t_c$. In\nthe midway between two succeeding quasiequilibria, the system experiences a\ntransient state, where one particle keeps exclusive high energy and its motion\ndecouples with the others.

Thus the macroscopic relaxation we discussed in the previous\npapers corresponds to the transition from one of quasiequilibria to a transient\nstate. Averaging the behavior over a time scale much longer than the\nmacroscopic relaxation time gives the isothermal distribution. Distribution of\nlifetime $\\tau$ of the transient states yields a power-law distribution of\n$\\tau^{-2}$.
