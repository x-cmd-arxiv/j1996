It has the unusual feature that in\nthe presence of a false vacuum there is a {\\em stable} static solution with the\ndilaton field displaced from the minimum of its potential, giving perfect de\nSitter expansion. We demonstrate how this solution can be used to implement the\nopen inflationary universe scenario. The necessary second phase of inflation\nafter false vacuum decay by bubble nucleation is driven by the dilaton rolling\nfrom the static point to the minimum of its potential. Because the static\nsolution is stable whilst the false vacuum persists, the required evolution\noccurs for a wide range of initial conditions. As the exterior of the bubble is\nperfect de Sitter space, there is no problem with fields rolling outside the\nbubble, as in one of the related models considered by Linde and Mezhlumian, and\nthe expansion rates before and after tunnelling may be similar which prevents\nproblematic high-amplitude super-curvature modes from being generated.

Based on the\nresearch in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems,\nnonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have\nidentified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning\norganizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that\nperceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure\nand behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to\nperform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical\nmethods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to\nunify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program\nwritten in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous\nfield and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level\ndescriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a\nmulti-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by\nforming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of\ngeneric operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to\nperform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and\nsuccessively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the\nneighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To\nillustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three\nimplemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the\nspatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of\ncommonly used routines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

For the d' with\nquantum numbers J^P=0^-, T=0, we employ a six-quark shell-model wave function\nwith a spatial s^5p [51]_X-configuration with N=1 harmonic oscillator quanta.\nIt is shown that the pionic decay width depends strongly on the mass and size\nof the d'. In the case that the calculated d' mass is close to the experimental\none a small pionic decay width of 0.04 MeV is obtained. This is an order of\nmagnitude smaller than the experimentally suggested value of 0.5 MeV. Two\npossibilities to improve the calculated width are suggested. The effect of the\nnonstatic correction term in the transition operator and the influence of the\nform factor at the decay vertex on the decay width are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 1996 07:42:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}

To this end a new fitting\nfunction for the two-particle correlation function is proposed. Its usefulness\nis demonstrated for a typical expanding model source, and it is shown how the\ndependence of the resulting fit parameters on the momentum of the particle pair\ncan be used to measure the longitudinal and transverse expansion of the source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 1996 13:23:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}
