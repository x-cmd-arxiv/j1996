The model differs from the CM model in\nthe treatment of the rate of energy input $n_s(k)$ from the source that\ngenerates the turbulence. In the present model, $n_s(k)$ is controlled by both\nthe {\\it source} and {\\it the turbulence} it ultimately generates, thus\nensuring a selfconsistent modeling of the turbulence. This improves the CM\nmodel in which $n_s(k)$ was taken to be equal to the growth rate of the {\\it\nlinear} unstable convective modes.\n  However, since the formulation of a selfconsistent treatment is far from\nsimple, we were forced to use a representation of the nonlinear interactions\nless complete than the one in the CM model. The ensuing equations were solved\nnumerically for a wide range of convective efficiencies. The results are the\nconvective flux, the mean square turbulent velocity, the root mean squared\nturbulent pressure and the turbulent viscosity.\n  We implemented the model in the ATON stellar structure code and computed the\nevolution of a solar model. The results are generally similar to those of the\nCM model and thus quite different from the MLT. The present model requires a\nsmaller overshoot into the upper radiative zone than does the CM model, in\naccord with recent empirical estimates. Application to POP II stars and\ncomparison with the very metal-poor globular cluster M68 yields an age in the\nrange $11\\div 12$ Gyr.

We re-examine the\ncontroversy by making systematic comparisons between numerical results obtained\nfor the PH and attractive Hubbard models. To do so, we have calculated the\nLuttinger parameters (spin and charge velocities, stiffnesses, etc...) of the\ntwo models using both the Density Matrix Renormalization Group method for large\nsystems and Lancz\\'os calculations with twisted boundary conditions for smaller\nsystems. Although most of our results confirm that both models are very similar\nwe have found some important differences in the spin properties for the small\nsizes considered by previous numerical studies (6-12 sites). However, we show\nthat these differences disappear at larger sizes (14-42 sites) when\nsufficiently accurate eigenstates are considered. Accordingly, our results\nstrongly suggest that the ground-state phase transition previously found for\nsmall systems is a finite size artefact. Interpreting our results within the\nframework of the Luttinger liquid theory, we discuss the origin of the apparent\ncontradiction between the predictions of the perturbative Renormalization group\napproach and numerical calculations at small sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 1996 13:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The manifolds are described by the iso-spectral\nflows of indefinite Toda lattice equations introduced by the authors [Physica,\n91D (1996), 321-339]. These Toda lattices consist of $2^{N-1}$ different\nsystems with hamiltonians $H = (1/2) \\sum_{k=1}^{N} y_k^2 + \\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\ns_ks_{k+1} \\exp(x_k-x_{k+1})$, where $s_i=\\pm 1$.
