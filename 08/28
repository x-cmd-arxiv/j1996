The problem has\ndifferent solutions in even and odd dimensions. In even dimensions the\nrepresentation is just a generalization of one in four dimensions (it has been\nknown before). In this case a gauge invariant part of the effective action in\nthe path integral has a form of the standard (Berezin-Marinov) pseudoclassical\naction. In odd dimensions the solution is presented for the first time and, in\nparticular, it turns out that the gauge invariant part of the effective action\ndiffers from the standard one. We propose this new action as a candidate to\ndescribe spinning particles in odd dimensions. Studying the hamiltonization of\nthe pseudoclassical theory with this action, we show that the operator\nquantization leads to adequate minimal quantum theory of spinning particles in\nodd dimensions. In contrast with the models proposed formerly in this case the\nnew one admits both the operator and the path integral quantization. Finally\nthe consideration is generalized for the case of the particle with anomalous\nmagnetic moment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 1996 19:18:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
