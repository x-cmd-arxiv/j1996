The latter case is particularly insidious since it leads to a\nreduction of the $\\eslt$ as well as leptonic signals for supersymmetry. We\nevaluate cross sections for jets plus $\\eslt$, 1$\\ell$, $2\\ell$ (same-sign and\nopposite sign) and $3\\ell$ event topologies that result from the simultaneous\nproduction of all sparticles at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC), assuming\nthat the lightest supersymmetric particle $\\tz_1$ decays hadronically inside\nthe detector via $R$-parity violating interactions. We assume that these\ninteractions do not affect the production rates or decays of other sparticles.\nWe examine the SUSY reach of the LHC for this ``pessimistic'' scenario, and\nshow that experiments at the LHC will still be able to search for gluinos and\nsquarks as heavy as 1 TeV, given just 10 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity,\neven with cuts designed to explore the canonical SUSY framework with a {\\it\nconserved} $R$-parity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Aug 1996 18:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

In addition to the usual ultraviolet cut-off which is necessary since\nthe model is non-renormalizable, we also introduce an infrared cut-off which\ndrops off the unknown confinement part of the quark interaction, which is\nbelieved to be less important for the flavor dynamics. The infrared cut-off\neliminates all q-qbar thresholds, which plague the application of the usual NJL\nmodel beyond low-energy pion physics. We apply this two-cut-off prescription to\nthe extended NJL model with chiral and heavy quark symmetries proposed recently\nby us.
