Based on an a priori kinematic study, we\nseparate the stars into halo and thick disk sub-populations. Statistical\nparallax solutions on these sub-samples yield M_V(RR) = +0.71 +/- 0.12 at\n<[Fe/H]> = -1.61 for the halo (162 stars), and M_V(RR) = +0.79 +/- 0.30 at\n<[Fe/H]> = -0.76 for the thick disk (51 stars). The solutions yield kinematic\nparameters (solar motion and velocity ellipsoid) in good agreement with\nestimates of the halo and thick disk kinematics derived from both RR Lyrae\nstars and other stellar tracers. Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the\nsolutions are accurate, and that the errors may be smaller than the estimates\nabove.

We discuss the accuracy of this approach and conclude that, for\nquantities whose determination is dominated by the infrared, the classical\nmethod should be correct up to parametrically suppressed (ie O(alpha))\ncorrections. For a Higgs self-coupling which at tree level corresponds to m_H ~\n50 GeV, we determine the jump in the order parameter to be delta phi = 1.5 gT,\nthe surface tension to be sigma = 0.07 g^4 T^3, and the friction coefficient on\nthe moving bubble wall due to infrared bosons to be \\eta = P/v_w = 0.03 \\pm\n.004 g^6 T^4.
