The geometric optics approximation\nis formulated in terms of such flux integrals, and three examples are\ninvestigated in detail in order to determine the possible effects of wave\ntails. The approximation is valid for waves in Minkowski space-time (tail-free)\nand waves in Schwarzschild space-time (weak tails) but it is shown how the\napproximation can break down in a cosmological scenario due to destructive\ninterference by strong tails. In this last situation, the waves do not radiate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Aug 1996 10:55:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 1996 09:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

Different physical systems are modeled by\ndifferent Hamiltonians and environment operators. The program achieves\nflexibility and user friendliness, without sacrificing execution speed, through\nthe way it represents operators and states in Hilbert space. Primary operators,\nimplemented in the form of simple routines acting on single degrees of freedom,\ncan be used to build up arbitrarily complex operators in product Hilbert spaces\nwith arbitrary numbers of components. Standard algebraic notation is used to\nbuild operators and to perform arithmetic operations on operators and states.\nStates can be represented in a local moving basis, often leading to dramatic\nsavings of computing resources. The state and operator classes are very general\nand can be used independently of the quantum trajectory algorithms.
