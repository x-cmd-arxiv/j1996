Due to a separation of charges to opposite sides of the well, a\nsingle wide well can be modelled as an effective two level system. We provide\nnumerical evidence of the existence of a phase transition from an\nincompressible to a compressible state as the electron density is increased for\nspecific well width. Our numerical results show a critical electron density\nwhich depends on well width, beyond which a transition incompressible double\nlayer quantum Hall state to a mono-layer compressible state occurs. We also\ncalculate the related phase boundary corresponding to destruction of the\ncollective mode energy gap. We show that the effective tunneling term and the\ninterlayer separation are both renormalised by the strong magnetic field. We\nalso exploite the local density functional techniques in the presence of strong\nmagnetic field at $\\nu=1$ to calculate renormalized $\\Delta_{SAS}$. The\nnumerical results shows good agreement between many-body calculations and local\ndensity functional techniques in the presence of a strong magnetic field at\n$\\nu=1$. we also discuss implications of this work on the $\\nu=1/2$\nincompressible state observed in SWQW.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 1996 22:36:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

This explanation is based on the hypothesis that samples which show\nthis behavior contain density inhomogeneities. Theory then relates the\nnon-universal conductance peak-heights to the ``number of alternating\npercolation clusters'' of a continuum percolation model defined on the\nspatially-varying local carrier density. We discuss the statistical properties\nof the number of alternating percolation clusters for Corbino disc samples\ncharacterized by random density fluctuations which have a correlation length\nsmall compared to the sample size. This allows a determination of the\nstatistical properties of the low-temperature conductance peak-heights of such\nsamples. We focus on a range of filling fraction at the center of the plateau\ntransition for which the percolation model may be considered to be critical. We\nappeal to conformal invariance of critical percolation and argue that the\nproperties of interest are directly related to the corresponding quantities\ncalculated numerically for bond-percolation on a cylinder. Our results allow a\nlower bound to be placed on the non-universal conductance peak-heights, and we\ncompare these results with recent experimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Aug 1996 18:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Nov 1996 11:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
