We show that a point mass plus weak shear lens produces an astroid-\nshaped caustic and that the magnification cross-section obeys a simple scaling\nproperty. By convolving this cross-section with the shear distribution, we\nobtain a caustic-induced feature in P(A) which also exhibits a simple scaling\nproperty. This feature results in a 20% enhancement in P(A) at A approx 2/tau.\nIn the low magnification (A-1 << 1) limit, the macroimage consists of a bright\nprimary image and a large number of faint secondary images formed close to each\nof the point masses. Taking into account the correlations between the primary\nand secondary images, we derive P(A) for low A. The low-A distribution has a\npeak of amplitude ~ 1/tau^2 at A-1 ~ tau^2 and matches smoothly to the high-A\ndistribution. We combine the high- and low-A results and obtain a practical\nsemi-analytic expression for P(A).

The lecture notes contain an introduction\nto quantum groups, $q$-special functions and their interplay. After\ngeneralities on Hopf algebras, orthogonal polynomials and basic hypergeometric\nseries we work out the relation between the quantum SU(2) group and the\nAskey-Wilson polynomials out in detail as the main example. As an application\nwe derive an addition formula for a two-parameter subfamily of Askey-Wilson\npolynomials. A relation between the Al-Salam and Chihara polynomials and the\nquantised universal enveloping algebra for $su(1,1)$ is given. Finally, more\nexamples and other approaches as well as some open problems are given.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 1996 08:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
