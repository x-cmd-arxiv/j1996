Such a system can be described by the surface\ntension $\\sigma$, the bag constant $B$, and the fermion number density\n$\\rho_{0}$. Usually one of these parameters prevails in the system and thus\naffects the spacetime inside the soliton. Whether it is described by Friedman\nor de Sitter metric depends on the prevailing parameter. The whole spacetime is\ndevided by the surface of the soliton into the false vacuum region inside the\nsoliton and the true vacuum region outside, the latter being described by the\nSchwarzschild line element. The aim of this paper is to study the equations of\nmotion of the domain wall in two cases. In the first case the de Sitter metric\ndescribes the interior in the first case, and in the second case it is replaced\nby the Friedman metric. In both of them the Schwarzschild metric is outside the\nsoliton. From the analysis of obtained equations one can draw conclusions\nconcerning further evolution of a soliton star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Aug 1996 13:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

This, in fact, appears to be the case of static, uniform--density\nmodels of the interior metric of cosmic strings and neutron stars. We consider\nthe fourth order semiclassical equations and first look for perturbative\nsolutions in the coupling constants $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ of the quadratic\ncurvature terms in the effective gravitational Lagrangian. We find that there\nis not a consistent solution; neither for strings nor for spherical stars. We\nthen look for non--perturbative solutions and find an explicit approximate\nmetric for the case of straight cosmic strings. We finally analyse the\ncontribution of the non--local terms to the renormalized energy--momentum\ntensor and the possibility of this terms to allow for a perturbative solution.\nWe explicitly build up a particular renormalized energy--momentum tensor to\nfulfill that end. These state--dependent corrections are found by simple\nconsiderations of symmetry, conservation law and trace anomaly, and are chosen\nto compensate for the local terms. However, they are not only ad hoc, but have\nto depend on $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, what is not expected to first perturbative\norder. We then conclude that non--perturbative solutions are valuable for\ndescribing certain physical situations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 1996 22:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
