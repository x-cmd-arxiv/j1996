In this limit, the static response of electrons\nto a spatially varying magnetic field is largely determined by kinetic energy\nconsiderations.

After some preliminary materiel, we define the ``flexible sheaf''\ncondition. This descent condition (known to Thomason) is the same as what\nJardine called being ``flasque'' with respect to the presheaves representable\nby objects in the site; and it is more recently known as the condition of being\nan $n$-stack. We construct the flexible sheaf associated to a flexible presheaf\nin the $n$-truncated case, as an application of a certain natural operation\n$n+2$ times. We prove an analogue of Vogt's theorem for the case where the\nGrothendieck topology is nontrivial, identifying the set of morphisms in\nIllusie's derived category as the set of homotopy classes of homotopy-coherent\nmorphisms between flexible sheaves. The homotopy-coherent point of view allows\none easily to define the flexible mapping sheaf $Hom (R,T)$ between two\nflexible sheaves.\n  This revision fills major gaps in the bibliography.
