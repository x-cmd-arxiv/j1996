The tropical-polar density contrast and the east-west\npressure difference are connected by an adjustment process. In flat-bottomed\nocean models the adjustment is associated with viscous, baroclinic Kelvin wave\npropagation. Weak-high latitude stratification leads to the adjustment having\nan interdecadal timescale. We reexamine model interdecadal oscillations in the\ncontext of the adjustment process, for both constant flux and mixed surface\nboundary conditions. Under constant surface flux, interdecadal oscillations are\nassociated with the passage of a viscous Kelvin wave around the model domain.\nOur results suggest the oscillations can be self-sustained by perturbations to\nthe western boundary current arising from the southward boundary wave\npropagation. Mixed boundary condition oscillations are characterized by the\neastward, cross-basin movement of salinity-dominated density anomalies, and the\nwestward return of these anomalies along the northern boundary. We suggest the\nlatter is associated with viscous Kelvin wave propagation. Under both types of\nboundary conditions, the strength of the thermohaline overturning and the\ntropical-polar density contrast vary out of phase. We show how the phase\nrelationship is related to the boundary wave propagation. The importance of\nboundary regions indicates an urgent need to examine the robustness of\ninterdecadal variability in models as the resolution is increased, and as the\nrepresentation of the coastal, shelf/slope wave guide is improved.

To\nsurmount these in framework of Maxwellian theory, a novel convection\ndisplacement current is considered as additional and complementary to the\nfamous Maxwell displacement current. It is shown that this form of the\nMaxwell-Lorentz equations is similar to that proposed by Hertz for\nelectrodynamics of bodies in motion. Original Maxwell's equations can be\nconsidered as a valid approximation for a continuous and closed (or going to\ninfinity) conduction current. It is also proved that our novel form of the\nMaxwell-Lorentz equations is relativistically invariant. In particular, a\nrelativistically invariant gauge for quasistatic fields has been found to\nreplace the non-invariant Coulomb gauge. The new gauge condition contains the\nfamous relationship between electric and magnetic potentials for one uniformly\nmoving charge that is usually attributed to the Lorentz transformations. Thus,\nfor the first time, using the convection displacement current, a physical\ninterpretation is given to the relationship between the components of the\nfour-vector of quasistatic potentials. A rigorous application of the new gauge\ntransformation with the Lorentz gauge transforms the basic field equations into\nan independent pair of differential equations responsible for longitudinal and\ntransverse fields, respectively. The longitudinal components can be interpreted\nexclusively from the standpoint of the instantaneous \"action at a distance\"\nconcept and leads to necessary conceptual revision of the conventional\nFaraday-Maxwell field.

For a sample of uniform thickness the\norder parameter is uniform, but even infinitesimal deviations from uniform\nthickness give rise to a singly connected state in which the order parameter\nvanishes at a suitable layer, so that the superconducting part does not enclose\nthe magnetic field. The stability domain of this singly connected state is a\nline segment in the magnetic field-temperature plane, delimited by two critical\npoints.
