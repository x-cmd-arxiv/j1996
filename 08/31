Here we show that, on the contrary, self-gravity\nitself may be the dominant factor in making clouds fractal. We develop a\nfield-theory approach to the structure of clouds, assuming them to be\nisothermal, and with only gravitational interactions; we find that the observed\nfractal dimension of the clouds arise naturally from this approach. Although\nthis result does not imply that turbulence is not important, it does\ndemonstrate that the fractal structure can be understood without it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 1996 16:01:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

The production of antikaons from both\nbaryon-baryon and pion-baryon collisions are included. Taking into account only\nelastic and inelastic collisions of the antikaon with nucleons and neglecting\nits mean-field potential as in the cascade model, a strong antiflow or\nanti-correlation of antikaons with respect to nucleons is seen as a result of\nthe strong absorption of antikaons by nucleons. However, the antiflow of\nantikaons disappears after including also their propagation in the attractive\nmean-field potential. The experimental measurement of antikaon flow in\nheavy-ion collision will be very useful in shedding lights on the relative\nimportance of antikaon absorption versus its mean-field potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 1996 22:54:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Oct 1996 20:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}
