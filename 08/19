The non-overlapping parts of the\ngalaxies and symmetry considerations are used to reconstruct, via differential\nphotometry, how much background galaxy light is lost in passing through the\nforeground disks. Extensive catalog searches yield ~15-25 nearby galaxy pairs\nsuitable for varying degrees of our analysis; ten of the best such examples are\npresented here. From these pairs, we find that interarm extinction is modest,\ndeclining from A_B ~1 magnitude at 0.3 R_25^B to essentially zero by R_25^B;\nthe interarm dust has a scale length consistent with that of the disk\nstarlight. In contrast, dust in spiral arms and resonance rings may be\noptically thick (A_B > 2) at virtually any radius. Some disks have flatter\nextinction curves than the Galaxy, with A_B/A_I = 1.6; this is probably the\nsignature of clumpy dust distributions. Even though typical spirals are not\noptically thick throughout their disks, where they {\\it are} optically thick is\ncorrelated with where they are most luminous: in spiral arms and inner disks.\nThis correlation between absorption and emission regions may account for their\napparent surface brightness being only mildly dependent on inclination,\nerroneously indicating that spirals are generally optically thick. Taken as an\nensemble, the opacities of spiral galaxies may be just great enough to\nsignificantly affect QSO counts, though not enough to cause their high redshift\ncutoff.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Aug 1996 05:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2007-05-23"}

We calculate the absorption and the scattering\ncross-sections for SAW's as a function of the area of the dot, A, the sound\nwave vector, q, and the diffusion coefficient D of the electrons.
