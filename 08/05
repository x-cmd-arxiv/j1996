We study the effects of a messenger sector in which the\nsupersymmetry-violating F-term contributions to messenger scalar masses are\ncomparable to the supersymmetry-preserving ones. We also argue that it is not\nparticularly natural to restrict attention to models in which the messenger\nfields lie in complete SU(5) GUT multiplets, and we identify a much larger\nclass of viable models. Remarkably, however, we find that the superpartner mass\nparameters in these models are still subject to many significant contraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 1996 03:56:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Oct 1996 16:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
