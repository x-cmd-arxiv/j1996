Assuming rapid local\nthermalization, the evolution of such plasmas is computed using longitudinal\nboost-invariant 3+1-dimensional hydrodynamics. We compare the evolution in case\nthat the speed of sound in the plasma is constant to one resulting from an\nequation of state involving a strong first order transition, with a minimum of\nthe velocity of sound as a function of energy density. We find that azimuthally\nasymmetric fluctuations and correlations of the transverse energy flow can\ndevelop in both cases due to the initial inhomogeneities. Hot spots also\nenhance significantly high-transverse momenta direct photon yields. In the case\nwith a phase transition, the hadronization surface evolves into an unusual\nfoam-like structure. Also in that case, we find that hadronization is\nconsiderably delayed relative to the ideal gas case, just as previous studies\nhave found for homogeneous initial conditions. The time-delay signature of a\nrapid cross-over transition region in the QCD equation of state (as observable\nvia meson interferometry) is thus found to be remarkably robust to\nuncertainties in the initial conditions in heavy-ion reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Sep 1996 21:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-09"}
