I first explore temporal\nlinguistic phenomena that are likely to appear in English questions to NLITDBs.\nDrawing on existing linguistic theories of time, I formulate an account for a\nlarge number of these phenomena that is simple enough to be embodied in\npractical NLITDBs. Exploiting ideas from temporal logics, I then define a\ntemporal meaning representation language, TOP, and I show how the HPSG grammar\ntheory can be modified to incorporate the tense and aspect account of this\nthesis, and to map a wide range of English questions involving time to\nappropriate TOP expressions. Finally, I present and prove the correctness of a\nmethod to translate from TOP to TSQL2, TSQL2 being a temporal extension of the\nSQL-92 database language. This way, I establish a sound route from English\nquestions involving time to a general-purpose temporal database language, that\ncan act as a principled framework for building NLITDBs. To demonstrate that\nthis framework is workable, I employ it to develop a prototype NLITDB,\nimplemented using ALE and Prolog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Sep 1996 14:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
