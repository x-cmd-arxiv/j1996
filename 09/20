We consider fluid discs with a range of thicknesses and\nbinaries with a range of mass ratios, orbital separations and inclination\nangles. Our numerical simulations are implemented using a SPH code. For our\nunperturbed disc models, we write a scaling relation for the shear viscosity\nand deduce that the disc thickness cannot be varied without affecting the\nviscosity in these kinds of SPH disc models. It is found that maintainance of\nan inner cavity owing to the tidal truncation of the disc is effective for\nnon-zero orbital inclinations. Also we show that our model discs may precess\napproximately like rigid bodies, provided that the disc is able to communicate\non a length scale comparable to the inner boundary radius by either sonic or\nviscous effects, in a sufficiently small fraction of the local precession\nperiod. Furthermore, the disc precession period may tend to infinity if the\ndisc outer edge is allowed to become arbitrarily large, the disc suffering only\na modest quasi-steady warp near the inner boundary. When the disc response is\nlinear, or weakly non-linear, the precession periods and the forms of warping\nthat we measure yield reasonable quantitative agreement with the analytical\nexpressions that we derive from a linear response calculation. For a stronger\ndisc response the results can agree poorly with our linear analysis, although\nsome qualitative features of the response remain intact.

These zero eigenvalues are ``kinematical\"\nin the sense that they are independent of randomness. We study the eigenvalue\ndistribution of these matrices to leading order in the large $N,M$ limit, in\nwhich the ``rectangularity\" $r={M\\over N}$ is held fixed. We apply a variety of\nmethods in our study. We study Gaussian ensembles by a simple diagrammatic\nmethod, by the Dyson gas approach, and by a generalization of the Kazakov\nmethod. These methods make use of the invariance of such ensembles under the\naction of symmetry groups. The more complicated Wigner ensemble, which does not\nenjoy such symmetry properties, is studied by large $N$ renormalization\ntechniques. In addition to the kinematical $\\delta$-function spike in the\neigenvalue density which corresponds to zero eigenvalues, we find for both\ntypes of ensembles that if $|r-1|$ is held fixed as $N\\rightarrow\\infty$, the\n$N$ non-zero eigenvalues give rise to two separated lobes that are located\nsymmetrically with respect to the origin. This separation arises because the\nnon-zero eigenvalues are repelled macroscopically from the origin. Finally, we\nstudy the oscillatory behavior of the eigenvalue distribution near the\nendpoints of the lobes, a behavior governed by Airy functions. As $r\\rightarrow\n1$ the lobes come closer, and the Airy oscillatory behavior near the endpoints\nthat are close to zero breaks down. We interpret this breakdown as a signal\nthat $r\\rightarrow 1$ drives a cross over to the oscillation governed by Bessel\nfunctions near the origin for matrices made of square blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 1996 17:37:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Sep 1996 00:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

We demonstrate that in a\nconstrained geometry the standard Landau diamagnetic response is always\npresent, but is dominated by finite-size corrections of a quasi-random sign\nwhich may be orders of magnitude larger. These corrections are very sensitive\nto the nature of the classical dynamics. Systems which are integrable at zero\nmagnetic field exhibit larger magnetic response than those which are chaotic.\nThis difference arises from the large oscillations of the density of states in\nintegrable systems due to the existence of families of periodic orbits. The\nconnection between quantum and classical behavior naturally arises from the use\nof semiclassical expansions. This key tool becomes particularly simple and\ninsightful at finite temperature, where only short classical trajectories need\nto be kept in the expansion.

By matching a post-Newtonian solution for the\ngravitational field inside the system to a post-Minkowskian solution (obtained\nin a previous work) for the gravitational field exterior to the system, we\ndetermine the 1PN relativistic corrections to the ``Newtonian\" radiation\nreaction potential of Burke and Thorne. The 1PN reaction potential involves\nboth scalar and vectorial components, with the scalar component depending on\nthe mass-type quadrupole and octupole moments of the system, and the vectorial\ncomponent depending in particular on the current-type quadrupole moment. In the\ncase of binary systems, the 1PN radiation reaction potential has been shown to\nyield consistent results for the 3.5PN approximation in the binary's equations\nof motion. Adding up the effects of tails, the radiation reaction is then\nwritten to 1.5PN order.

We\npropose to reconsider this ansatz and try to redefine such fundamental notions\nas supermanifolds, fiber bundles and homotopies using some weakening\ninvertibility conditions. The prefix semi- reflects the fact that the\nunderlying morphisms form corresponding semigroups consisting of a known group\npart and a new ideal noninvertible part. We found that the absence of\ninvertibility gives us the generalization of the cocycle conditions for\ntransition functions of supermanifolds and fiber bundles in a natural way,\nwhich can lead to construction of noninvertible analogs of \\v{C}ech cocycles.\nWe define semi-homotopies, which can be noninvertible and describe mappings\ninto the semi-supermanifolds introduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Sep 1996 18:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
