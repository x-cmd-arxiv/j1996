In pursuit of that goal, the thesis makes two\nmain theoretical contributions: (i) it identifies a new class of designs by\nspecifying an architecture for natural language analysis in which probabilities\nare given to semantic forms rather than to more superficial linguistic\nelements; and (ii) it explores the development of a mathematical theory to\npredict the expected accuracy of statistical language learning systems in terms\nof the volume of data used to train them.\n  The theoretical work is illustrated by applying statistical language learning\ndesigns to the analysis of noun compounds. Both syntactic and semantic analysis\nof noun compounds are attempted using the proposed architecture. Empirical\ncomparisons demonstrate that the proposed syntactic model is significantly\nbetter than those previously suggested, approaching the performance of human\njudges on the same task, and that the proposed semantic model, the first\nstatistical approach to this problem, exhibits significantly better accuracy\nthan the baseline strategy. These results suggest that the new class of designs\nidentified is a promising one. The experiments also serve to highlight the need\nfor a widely applicable theory of data requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 1996 07:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}

By introducing a\nspatio-temporal coding, we prove the one-to-one correspondence between the set\nof global orbits and the set of admissible codes. This relationship is applied\nto the study of the (uniform) fronts' dynamics. It is shown that, for any given\nvelocity in $[-1,1]$, there is a parameter set for which the fronts with that\nvelocity exist and their shape is unique. The dependence of the velocity of the\nfronts on the local map's discontinuity is proved to be a Devil's staircase.\nMoreover, the linear stability of the global orbits which do not reach the\ndiscontinuity follows directly from our simple map. For the fronts, this\nstatement is improved and as a consequence, the velocity of all the propagating\ninterfaces is computed for any parameter. The fronts are shown to be also\nnonlinearly stable under some restrictions on the parameters. Actually, these\nrestrictions follow from the co-existence of uniform fronts and non-uniformly\ntravelling fronts for strong coupling. Finally, these results are extended to\nsome $C^{\\infty}$ local maps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Sep 1996 00:46:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
