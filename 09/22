However, quantum\ngravity may eventually provide classical spacetimes by giving spectral data\nsimilar to those appearing in noncommutative geometry, rather than by giving\ndirectly a spacetime manifold. It is shown that a globally hyperbolic\nLorentzian manifold can be given by spectral data. A new phenomenon in the\ncontext of spectral geometry is observed: causal relationships. The employment\nof the causal relationships of spectral data is shown to lead to a highly\nefficient description of Lorentzian manifolds, indicating the possible\nusefulness of this approach. Connections to free quantum field theory are\ndiscussed for both motivation and physical interpretation. It is conjectured\nthat the necessary spectral data can be generically obtained from an effective\nfield theory having the fundamental structures of generalized quantum\nmechanics: a decoherence functional and a choice of histories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Sep 1996 16:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}
