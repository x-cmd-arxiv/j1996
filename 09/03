It is found that both the CERES\nand HELIOS-3 data for dilepton spectra in proton-nucleus reactions can be well\ndescribed by the conventional mechanism of Dalitz decay and direct vector meson\ndecay. However, to provide a quantitative explanation of the observed dilepton\nspectra in central S+Au and S+W collisions requires contributions other than\nthese direct decays. Introducing a decrease of vector meson masses in hot dense\nmedium, we find that these heavy-ion data can also be satisfactorily explained.\nWe also give predictions for Pb+Au collisions at 160 GeV/nucleon using current\nCERES mass resolution and acceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Sep 1996 20:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
