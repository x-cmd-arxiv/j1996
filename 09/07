The\nanalysis of the Gibbs ensemble, where all integrals of motion are respected,\npredicts the initial state to evolve into an equilibrium, stable coherent\nstructure (the most probable state) and decaying Gaussian turbulence\n(fluctuations) with a vanishing, but always positive temperature. The\nnon-dissipative turbulence decay is accompanied by decrease in both the\namplitude and the length scale of the fluctuations, so that the fluctuation\nenergy remains finite. The coherent structure represents a set of singular\nmagnetic islands with plasma flow whose magnetic topology is identical to that\nof the initial state, while the energy and the cross topology invariants are\nshared between the coherent structure and the Gaussian turbulence. These\nconservation laws suggest the variational principle of iso-topological\nrelaxation which allows us to predict the appearance of the final state from a\ngiven initial state. For a generic initial condition having X points in the\nmagnetic field, the coherent structure has universal types of singularities:\ncurrent sheets terminating at Y points. These structures, which are similar to\nthose resulting from the 2D relaxation of magnetic field frozen into an ideally\nconducting viscous fluid, are observed in the numerical experiment of Biskamp\nand Welter.
