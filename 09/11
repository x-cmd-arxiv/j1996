The infalling material eventually enters free-fall, so that, at\nsmall radii, the density profiles and velocity fields have the same power-law\nforms in logotropic and isothermal spheres both. However, the accretion rate\nonto a protostar is not constant in a logotrope, but grows in proportion to t^3\nduring the expansion wave. Thus, low-mass stars are accreted over longer times,\nand high-mass stars over shorter times, than expected in isothermal clouds.\nThis result has implications for the form and origin of the stellar IMF.
