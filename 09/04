A simple analytic model demonstrates that this artificial\nheating will dominate radiative cooling in any simulation where the mass of an\nindividual dark matter particle exceeds a certain critical value. This maximum\nmass depends only on the cooling function of the gas, on the fraction of the\nmaterial in gaseous form, and (weakly) on typical temperatures in the gas. It\nis comparable to, or smaller than, the dark matter particle masses employed in\nmost published simulations of cosmological hydrodynamics and galaxy formation.\nAny simulation which violates this constraint will be unable to follow cooling\nflows, although catastrophic cooling of gas may still occur in regions with\nvery short cooling times. We use a series of N--body/smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics simulations to explore this effect. In simulations which neglect\nradiative cooling, two--body heating causes a gradual expansion of the gas\ncomponent. When radiative effects are included, we find that gas cooling is\nalmost completely suppressed for dark matter particle masses above our limit.\nAlthough our test simulations use smoothed particle hydrodynamics, similar\neffects, and a similar critical mass, are expected in any simulation where the\ndark matter is represented by discrete particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Sep 1996 18:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

Most studies so far adopted the view that the periodic and\naperiodic variations are independent. However any aperiodic variability in the\nemission from the accretion column(s) towards the magnetic neutron star should\nbe modulated at the X-ray pulsar period, by virtue of the same rotation-induced\ngeometric effects which give rise to the periodic signal. We develop here a\nsimple shot noise model to test the presence of a coupling between the periodic\nand aperiodic variability of X-ray pulsars.

Using the\nso determined solutions, we compare the predictions of mode-coupling theory\n(MCT) with the results of a previously done molecular dynamics computer\nsimulation [Phys. Rev. E 51, 4626 (1995), ibid. 52, 4134 (1995)]. From this\ncomparison we conclude that MCT gives a fair estimate of the critical coupling\nconstant, a good estimate of the exponent parameter, predicts the wave-vector\ndependence of the various nonergodicity parameters very well, except for very\nlarge wave-vectors, and gives also a very good description of the space\ndependence of the various critical amplitudes. In an attempt to correct for\nsome of the remaining discrepancies between the theory and the results of the\nsimulation, we investigate two small (ad hoc) modifications of the theory. We\nfind that one modification gives a worse agreement between theory and\nsimulation, whereas the second one leads to an improved agreement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 1996 14:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-31"}
