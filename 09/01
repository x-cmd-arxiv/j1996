The first two techniques are\naimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is\nbased on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to\nselect plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero\ncommitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO\nprioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator\nparameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from\nthe definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a\npolynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the\noperator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter\ndomains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove\nspurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP,\nour improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors\nranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial\nfor the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest\nimprovements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave\nspeedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the\ndefault UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for\nour techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-09-25"}

Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or\nsentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit\ndiscourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and\nplan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for\nclassifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning\nprograms (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets\nof pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine\nlearning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the\ngeneration of classification models, but also for improving upon previous\nresults. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the\nliterature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain\nnew linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to\nautomatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively\nanalyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data.\nFinally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and\nflexible than manual methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Sep 1996 00:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-02-03"}
