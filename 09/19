Due to its proximity, NGC 55 provides a\nunique opportunity to study the disk--halo interface in a late--type galaxy\nwith unprecedented spatial resolution. Our images reveal a spectacular variety\nof ionized gas features, ranging from giant HII region complexes, to supergiant\nfilamentary and shell features, to patches of very faint diffuse emission. Many\nof these features protrude well above the plane of the galaxy, including a very\nfaint fragmented shell of emission which is visible at 2.6 kpc above the disk.\nWe identify candidate `chimneys' extending out of the disk, which could be the\nconduits into the halo for hot gas around disk star-forming regions, and could\nalso provide low-density paths for the passage of UV photons from the disk to\nthe halo. Several of the identified chimneys are `capped' with clumps of\nionized gas, one of which, located at 1.5 kpc above the disk plane, appears to\nbe the site of recent star formation. Emission--line ratios\n([OII]/Halpha+[NII], [SII]/Halpha+[NII]) constrain the ionization mechanism of\nthe gas, and our images allow the first measurement of [OII]/Halpha+[NII] in\nextra-planar diffuse ionized gas. The diffuse gas is characterized by\nemission--line ratios which are enhanced on average by a factor of two compared\nto those of bright HII regions. Each line ratio increases in value smoothly\nfrom the cores of HII regions, through the haloes of HII regions, into the\ndiffuse ionized gas.
