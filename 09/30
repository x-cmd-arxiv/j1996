They do, however,\ndepend on the boundary conditions in addition to the driving rate and the\nthrough-flow rate. Our analysis of the Ginzburg-Landau amplitude equation\nelucidates how the pattern selection can be described by a nonlinear eigenvalue\nproblem with the frequency being the eigenvalue. Approaching the border between\nabsolute and convective instability the eigenvalue problem becomes effectively\nlinear and the selection mechanism approaches that of linear front propagation.\nPACS: 47.54.+r,47.20.Ky,47.32.-y,47.20.Ft\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Sep 1996 07:45:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-30"}
