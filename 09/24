[The $\\tau^A$'s are the Teichm\\\"uller\nparameters, and the $p_A$'s are their conjugate momenta.]\n  As for the case of $g=1$, we find out that $Z$ is also related with another\nreduced form, whose dynamical variables are $(\\tau^A, p_A)$ and $(V, \\sigma)$.\n[Here $\\sigma$ is a conjugate momentum to 2-volume $V$.] A nontrivial factor\nappears in the measure in terms of this type of reduced form.

We show that both\nperturbative and non-perturbative approaches which involve convolution with the\nrho meson wave function predict values of sigma_T which fall-off too quickly\nwith increasing Q^2, in comparison with the data. We present a perturbative QCD\nmodel based on the open production of light qqbar pairs and parton-hadron\nduality, which describes all features of the data for rho electroproduction at\nhigh Q^2 and, in particular, predicts a satisfactory Q^2 behaviour of\nsigma_L/sigma_T. We find that precise measurements of the latter can give\nvaluable information on the Q^2 behaviour of the gluon distribution at small x.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Sep 1996 13:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-24"}
