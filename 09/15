These\nfeatures are caused by supernova ejecta in SN1006. We propose that the\nredshifted SiII2 1260 A feature consists of both unshocked and shocked SiII.\nThe sharp red edge of the line at 7070 km/s indicates the position of the\nreverse shock, while its Gaussian blue edge reveals shocked Si with a mean\nvelocity of 5050 km/s and a dispersion of 1240 km/s, implying a reverse shock\nvelocity of 2860 km/s. The measured velocities satisfy the energy jump\ncondition for a strong shock, provided that all the shock energy goes into\nions, with little or no collisionless heating of electrons. The line profiles\nof the SiIII and SiIV absorption features indicate that they arise mostly from\nshocked Si. The total mass of shocked and unshocked Si inferred from the SiII,\nSiIII and SiIV profiles is M_Si = 0.25 \\pm 0.01 Msun on the assumption of\nspherical symmetry. Unshocked Si extends upwards from 5600 km/s. Although there\nappears to be some Fe mixed with the Si at lower velocities < 7070 km/s, the\nabsence of FeII absorption with the same profile as the shocked SiII suggests\nlittle Fe mixed with Si at higher (before being shocked) velocities. The column\ndensity of shocked SiII is close to that expected for SiII undergoing steady\nstate collisional ionization behind the reverse shock, provided that the\nelectron to SiII ratio is low, from which we infer that most of the shocked Si\nis likely to be of a fairly high degree of purity, unmixed with other elements.\nWe propose that the ambient interstellar density on the far side of SN1006 is\nanomalously low compared to the density around the rest of the remnant.
