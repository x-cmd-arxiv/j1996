We\nalso discuss the various objections to this hypothesis. We assume that there\nwas a magnetic field present in the galactic plasma before the galaxy formed.\nAfter the galactic disk formed, the lines of force thread through it and remain\nconnected to the external cosmic medium. They enter through one side of the\ndisk, proceed horizontally a distance $ l $ in the disk, and then leave through\nthe other side. We find that the lines of force are stretched rotation of the\ngalactic disk, which amplifies the toroidal component of the field and\nincreases$l $. When the magnetic field is strong enough, it produces ambipolar\nvelocities that try to lift the line out of the galactic disk but in opposite\ndirections ondifferent parts of the line. The result is, instead of the line\nbeing expelled from the disk, its horizontal length $l $ is shortened, both in\nthe radial, and in the toroidal direction. This leads to a reduction of the\nrate of horizontal stretching, and, finally, a reduction in the magnetic field\nstrength. After a sufficient time, the magnetic field at all points goes\nthrough this stretching and reduction, and the field strength approaches a\nuniversal function of time. This function is slowly decreasing, and only\ndepends on the ambipolar propertiesof the interstellar medium. At any given\ntime the magnetic field is toroidal, and has the same strength almost\neverywhere. On the other hand, it turns out that its direction varies rapidly\nwith radius, changing sign every one hundred parsecs field dominate over that\nof the other. The resulting field has a net Faraday rotation. If such a field\nwere observed with low resolution in an external galaxy then the field would\nappear toroidal in between the spiral arms. The spiral density wave would turn\nit so that the lines appear to trace out the spiral arm,\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Sep 1996 16:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-08-30"}

We review what is\nknown about them, both from lattice and non-lattice approaches. A particularly\nsimple mechanism of the QCD chiral restoration phase transition is discussed\nfirst: it suggests that it is a transition from randomly placed tunneling\nevents (instantons) at low T to strongly localized tunneling-anti-tunneling\npairs at high T. Many features of the transition found on the lattice can be\nexplained in this simple picture. Very relevant for RHIC, this approach\npredicts a strong non-perturbative interaction between quarks $above$ the phase\ntransition. It also predicts that QGP-like phase sets in at $zero$ temperature,\nprovided few more light quark flavors are added to QCD. Finally, we also\ndiscuss possible experimental signatures of the QCD phase transition. One issue\nis CERN dilepton data, possibly related with ``dropping'' masses of $\\rho, A_1$\nmesons.
