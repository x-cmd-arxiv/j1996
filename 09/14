The high\nenergy part (100 MeV-1 GeV) of the machine is split in three beta-graded\nsections, and transverse focusing is provided via a periodic doublet array. All\nthe parameters, like power in the couplers and accelerating fields in the\ncavities, are within the state of the art, achieved in operating machines. A\nfirst stage of operation at 30 mA beam current is proposed, while the upgrade\nof the machine to 120 mA operation can be obtained increasing the number of\nklystrons and couplers per cavity. The additional coupler ports, up to four,\nwill be integrated in the cavity design. Preliminary calculations indicate that\nbeam transport is feasible, given the wide aperture of the 352 MHz structures.\nA capital cost of less than 100 M$ at 10 mA, reaching up to 280 M$ for the 120\nmA extension, has been estimated for the superconducting high energy section\n(100 MeV-1 GeV). The high efficiency of the proposed machine, reaching 50% at\n15 mA, makes it a good candidate for proposed nuclear waste incineration\nfacilities and Energy Amplifier studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Sep 1996 10:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
