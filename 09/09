Due to the Pauli exclusion principle\nit can be shown that neutrinos cannot be a major constituent of the halo dark\nmatter. As far as cold dark matter is concerned there might be a discrepancy\nbetween the results of the N-body simulations and the measured rotation curves\nfor dwarf galaxies. A fact this, if confirmed, which would exclude cold dark\nmatter as a viable candidate for the halo dark matter.\n  In the framework of a baryonic scenario the most plausible candidates are\nbrown or white dwarfs and cold molecular clouds (mainly of $H_2$).

By incorporating the anharmonic perturbation into the\nWKB energy splitting formula we show that the WKB approximation can be greatly\nimproved in the region over which the tunneling is appreciable. We also observe\nthat the usual WKB results can be obtained from our formalism as a limiting\ncase in which the two potential minima are far apart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Sep 1996 14:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2008-11-26"}
