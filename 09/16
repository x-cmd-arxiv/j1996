The\nstochastic vacuum model of Dosch and Simonov is presented in some detail. We\nshow how this model produces confinement. The model incorporates the idea of\nthe QCD vacuum acting like a dual superconductor due to an effective\nchromomagnetic monopole condensate. We turn then to high energy, small momentum\ntransfer hadron-hadron scattering. A field-theoretic formalism to treat these\nreactions is developed, where the basic quantities governing the scattering\namplitudes are correlation functions of light-like Wegner-Wilson lines and\nloops. The evaluation of these correlation functions with the help of the\nMinkowskian version of the stochastic vacuum model is discussed. A further\nsurprising manifestation of the nontrivial vacuum structure in QCD may be the\nproduction of anomalous soft photons in hadron-hadron collisions. We interpret\nthese photons as being due to `synchrotron radiation from the vacuum'. A\nduality argument leads us from there to the expectation of anomalous pieces\nproportional to $(Q^2)^{1/6}$ in the electric form factors of the nucleons for\nsmall $Q^2$. Finally we sketch the idea that in the Drell-Yan reaction, where a\nquark-antiquark pair annihilates with the production of a lepton pair, a\n`chromodynamic Sokolov-Ternov effect' may be at work.
