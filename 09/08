We have devised a robust chisquare minimization technique\nsimultaneously fitting the BVI light curves to parametrize the SN event as a\nfunction of (tb,m, m15(B)) where tb is the time of B maximum, m is the peak BVI\nmagnitude corrected for luminosity variations, and m15(B) is a single parameter\ndescribing the whole light curve morphology.
