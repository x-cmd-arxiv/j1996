In the ``Standard Model'' the\neffective potential can develop a non-standard minimum for values of the field\nmuch larger than the weak scale. Comparison of the decay rate to the\nnon-standard minimum at finite (and zero) temperature with the corresponding\nexpansion rate of the Universe allows to identify the region, in the ($M_H$,\n$M_t$)-plane which can be accomodated by the theory. In the ``Minimal\nSupersymmetric Standard Model'', approximate analytical expressions for the\nHiggs mass spectrum and couplings are worked out. An appropriate treatment of\nsquark decoupling allows to consider large values of the stop mixing parameters\nand thus fix a reliable upper bound on the mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs\nboson mass. The discovery of the Higgs boson at LEP2 might put an upper bound\n(below the Planck scale) on the scale of new physics $\\Lambda$ and eventually\ndisentangle between the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard\nModel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 1996 18:56:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-06"}
