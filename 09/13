In this paper we\ndescribe a new method of galaxy photometry adopted to derive the photometric\nparameters of the EFAR galaxies. The algorithm fits the circularized surface\nbrightness profiles as the sum of two seeing-convolved components, an $R^{1/4}$\nand an exponential law. This approach allows us to fit the large variety of\nluminosity profiles displayed by the EFAR galaxies homogeneously and to derive\n(for at least a subset of these) bulge and disk parameters. Multiple exposures\nof the same objects are optimally combined and an optional sky-fitting\nprocedure has been developed to correct for sky subtraction errors. Extensive\nMonte Carlo simulations are analyzed to test the performance of the algorithm\nand estimate the size of random and {\\it systematic} errors. Random errors are\nsmall, provided that the global signal-to-noise ratio of the fitted profiles is\nlarger than $\\approx 300$. Systematic errors can result from 1) errors in the\nsky subtraction, 2) the limited radial extent of the fitted profiles, 3) the\nlack of resolution due to seeing convolution and pixel sampling, 4) the use of\ncircularized profiles for very flattened objects seen edge-on and 5) a poor\nmatch of the fitting functions to the object profiles.

Recent experimental values and extrapolations of\nnuclear masses are used for a description of matter at densities below neutron\ndrip. Changes in the pressure of matter in the crust due to the stellar\nspin-down are calculated by taking into account the structure of the crust of a\nslowly and uniformly rotating relativistic neutron star. If the initial\nrotation period is $\\sim$ ms, these changes cause nuclei, initially being in\nthe ground-state matter above a mass density of about $3 \\times 10^{13} g\ncm^{-3}$, to absorb neutrons in the equatorial region where the matter\nundergoes compression, and to emit them in the vicinity of the rotation axis\nwhere the matter undergoes decompression.

Such problems can be characterized by the question as\nto how the asymptotic behaviours of solutions are related as the independent\nvariable is allowed to pass towards infinity along different directions in the\ncomplex plane. Connection problems have been previously tackled by a variety of\nmethods. Frequently these are based on the ideas of isomonodromic deformation\nand the matching of WKB solutions. However, the implementation of these methods\noften tends to be heuristic in nature and so the task of rigorising the process\nis complicated. The method we propose here develops uniform approximations to\nsolutions. This removes the need to match solutions, is rigorous, and can lead\nto the solution of connection problems with minimal computational effort. Our\nmethod is reliant on finding uniform approximations of differential equations\nof the generic form ${d^2\\phi}/{d\\eta^2} = - \\xi^2F(\\eta,\\xi)\\phi$ as the\ncomplex-valued parameter $\\xi \\to \\infty.$ The details of the treatment rely\nheavily on the locations of the zeros of the function $F$ in this limit. If\nthey are isolated then a uniform approximation to solutions can be derived in\nterms of Airy functions of suitable argument. On the other hand, if two of the\nzeros of $F$ coalesce as $|\\xi| \\to \\infty$ then an approximation can be\nderived in terms of parabolic cylinder functions. In this paper we discuss both\ncases, but illustrate our technique in action by applying the parabolic\ncylinder case to the ``classical'' connection problem associated with the\nsecond Painlev{\\'e} transcendent. Future papers will show how the technique can\nbe applied with very little change to the other Painlev{\\'e} equations, and to\nthe wider problem of the asymptotic behaviour of the general solution to any of\nthese equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Sep 1996 15:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2016-09-08"}
