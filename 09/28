The 0.5-10 keV X-ray spectrum consists\nof multiple components; (1) a continuum component heavily absorbed by a column\ndensity NH = 4E23 cm-2 above 3 keV; (2) a strong 6.4 keV line (EW = 500 eV);\n(3) a weak flat continuum between 1 and 3 keV; and (4) excess soft X-ray\nemission below 1 keV. The detection of strong absorption for the hard X-ray\ncomponent is firm evidence for an obscured active nucleus in this Seyfert 2\ngalaxy. The absorption corrected X-ray luminosity is about 2E42 erg/s. This is\nthe first time that the fluorescent iron-K line has been detected in this\nobject. The flat spectrum in the intermediate energy range may be a scattered\ncontinuum from the central source. The soft X-ray emission below 1 keV can be\nthermal emission from a temperature kT = 0.5 keV, consistent with the spatially\nextended emission observed by ROSAT HRI. However, the low abundance (0.05 Zs)\nand high mass flow rate required for the thermal model and an iron-K line\nstronger than expected from the obscuring torus model are puzzling. An\nalternative consistent solution can be obtained if the central source was a\nhundred times more luminous over than a thousand years ago. All the X-ray\nemission below 3 keV is then scattered radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 1996 17:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2015-06-24"}

In the spirit of Villain's approach for the\nferromagnetic case we divide thermal excitations into a low temperature long\nwavelength part (LW) and a high temperature short wavelength part (SW). In the\npresent work we mainly deal with LW excitations and we explicitly consider the\ncases of the fully frustrated triangular (FFTXY) and square ( FFSQXY) XY\nmodels. The novel aspect of our method is that it preserves the coupling\nbetween phase (spin angles) and chiral degrees of freedom. LW fluctuations\nconsist of coupled phase and chiral excitations. As a result, we find that for\nfrustrated systems the effective interactions between phase variables is long\nrange and oscillatory in contrast to the unfrustrated problem. Using Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulations we show that our analytical calculations produce\naccurate results at all temperature $T$; this is seen at low $T$ in the spin\nwave stiffness constant and in the staggered chirality; this is also the case\nnear $T_c$: transitions are driven by the SW part associated with domain walls\nand vortices, but the coupling between phase and chiral variables is still\nrelevant in the critical region. In that regime our analytical results yield\nthe correct $T$ dependence for bare couplings (given by the LW fluctuations)\nsuch as the Coulomb gas temperature $T_{CG}$ of the frustrated XY models . In\nparticular we find that $T_{CG}$ tracks chiral rather than phase fluctuations.\nOur results provides support for a single phase transition scenario in the\nFFTXY and FFSQXY models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Sep 1996 16:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2009-10-28"}

The quark condensate which is the order parameter\nfor the mode in which chiral symmetry is manifested is expected to change as\nmatter density or temperature is changed. The topics discussed are ``BR\nscaling,\" its connection to the structure of nuclei in Landau's Fermi liquid\ntheory and a variety of consequences on such nuclear properties as effective\nnucleon mass, nuclear gyromagnetic ratios, $g_A^\\star$, axial-charge\ntransitions in nuclei and on the fluctuations of nuclear matter into the\nstrange-flavor direction as observed in heavy-ion collisions. I will also\npresent a simple explanation of the recent dilepton data in the CERN-CERES\nheavy-ion experiments involving densities greater than that of nuclear matter\nand of the Indiana results on the longitudinally polarized proton scattering\nfrom heavy nuclei, evidencing dropping vector-meson masses in medium which can\nbe interpreted as signaling an aspect of chiral symmetry restoration in dense\nmedium.

Quantum channels have dual uses: they can be used to transmit known\nquantum states which code for classical information, and they can be used in a\npurely quantum manner, for transmitting or storing quantum entanglement. We\npropose here a definition of the von Neumann capacity of quantum channels,\nwhich is a quantum mechanical extension of the Shannon capacity and reverts to\nit in the classical limit. As such, the von Neumann capacity assumes the role\nof a classical or quantum capacity depending on the usage of the channel. In\nanalogy to the classical construction, this capacity is defined as the maximum\nvon Neumann mutual entropy processed by the channel, a measure which reduces to\nthe capacity for classical information transmission through quantum channels\n(the \"Kholevo capacity\") when known quantum states are sent. The quantum mutual\nentropy fulfills all basic requirements for a measure of information, and\nobserves quantum data-processing inequalities. We also derive a quantum Fano\ninequality relating the quantum loss of the channel to the fidelity of the\nquantum code. The quantities introduced are calculated explicitly for the\nquantum \"depolarizing\" channel.
