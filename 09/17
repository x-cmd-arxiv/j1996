Up to energies up to some tens of TeV of\nparticle energy it is possible to derive chemical abundances of cosmic rays. It\nhas been proposed that cosmic ray particles can be attributed to three main\nsites of origin and acceleration, a) supernova shocks in the interstellar\nmedium, b) supernova shocks in a stellar wind of the predecessor star, and c)\npowerful radio galaxies. This proposal leads to quantitative tests, which are\nencouraging sofar. Quantitative models for transport and interaction appear to\nbe consistent with the data. Li, Be, B are secondary in cosmic rays, as are\nmany of the odd-Z elements, as well as the sub-Fe elements. At very low\nenergies, cosmic ray particles are subject to ionization losses, which produce\na steep low energy cutoff; all particles below the cutoff are moved into the\nthermal material population, and the particles above it remain as cosmic rays.\nThis then changes the chemical abundances in the interstellar medium, and is a\ndominant process for many isotopes of Li, Be, B.

The variations over different time scales can be related to\neach other in a systematic way, similar to the Levy stable distribution\nproposed by Mandelbrot to describe real market indices.

Several\nattempts have been made by other groups to treat the BFKL type small x\nresummations instead as additions to the conventional anomalous dimensions of\nthe successful renormalization group ``Altarelli-Parisi'' equations. We\ndemonstrate that all presently available F_2 data, in particular at lower\nvalues of Q^2, can not be described using the presently known NLO (two-loop\nconsistent) small x resummations. Finally we comment on the common reason for\nthe failure of these BFKL inspired methods which result, in general, in too\nsteep x-dependencies as x -> 0.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Sep 1996 11:56:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Sep 1996 15:06:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 1997 16:48:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2014-11-17"}
